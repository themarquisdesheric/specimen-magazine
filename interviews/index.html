As the accent shows, I am from England, went through Cambridge University in the 70s, came to Berkeley as an assistant professor in '79 and stayed. So there you are. That's the short version. I do mathematical probability, so almost all of which is not interesting to anyone else as a sort of technical speciality, you know. In recent years, I've gotten interested in what are the connections between what we think about and teach as mathematicians and what in the real world — I hate using a phrase like \"real world,\" because what does it mean, but it's the best that I can come up with, you know.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe math traditionally started with throwing dice and tossing coins, certain very special things like this the math works fine for, and that's why casinos make money, etcetera, but most of what we think about in life is uncertainty about the future, course it's nothing like casino games, and the issue is whether mathematics has anything to say about that. So that's hopefully the \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nmore interesting side of what I think about, but it's all stuff that I'm not actually any academic expert on, maybe nobody is an academic expert on. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhy might no one be an expert on that? Is it just too new of a field?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt's not new. It's just too vague. In other words, academic life goes through things you can teach, things you can research on. That's all sort of… definite things. It's kind of like if you look at physics books, they say a lot about gravity and not much about friction. Even though everything you actually need to know about gravity for everyday life you say in a paragraph. Friction is much more complicated because it's sort of not amenable to nice math. Those sort of physicists tend to think of gravity or black holes or things that hopefully are amenable to math rather than lots of actual physical phenomenon. They sort of ignore it and say that's engineering, that's metallurgy, or something else. So there's a kind of selection. You want to teach definite things to students so you need to do research on definite things and not on rather vague things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo what are you working on, what have you been working on most recently?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe technical stuff I do tends to be, again… hard to explain. One background is the theory of algorithms, the rules by which computers actually do things. The software people are actually writing code. The code is the actual thing but there's some algorithms and logical rules that the code is implementing. And some of the algorithms, both the sort of routing of the internet at one very practical level but even more, all the mundane things an operating system does like being able to find a file when you ask for a file. Somebody at some point had to think about efficient ways of doing that and the first ways you think of tend not to be the most efficient. So there's some rather elaborate theory. The theory is probably much more elaborate than what's actually being used but there's elaborate theory on how to keep the million or so files that everyone has on their laptop. Most of them you don't actually see because they are part of the inner workings of it, but it's how you actually organize those so that you can find things when you need them. So that's one area of technical work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMostly mathematicians are sort of playing around and not doing anything very real. You are setting up rules for how hypothetical systems might work and you are then trying to see if you can mathematically prove what their behavior's going to be in terms of the given rules. So there's a big difference. So if you think about something like chess, there's a difference between understanding the rules of chess and understanding how chess actually works, how to play it well. So mathematicians tend to study systems defined by a few simple-sounding rules and then try to figure out what happens when you actually run the system.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo, you write a bit about the everyday applications of probability and perception.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, so that's probably what's more interesting to talk about. I got into this about 10 years ago when without thinking I sort of volunteered to teach a course with this title \u003Cem\u003EProbability in the Real World\u003C\u002Fem\u003E without having any plan of teaching something 9 months in advance, and then sort of realized that it's much harder to think of what to say in such a course. Teaching mathematics, the mathematics somehow… teaches itself isn't the right way of saying it, but because it's a logical structure, you have definitions, and theorems, and proofs. And they may have been hard originally for anyone to work these out. But once it's there, there's a sort of a logical structure you can go through and the stuff itself is somehow just there. It's like teaching someone how to build or repair a car. The car is actually there. You don't have to invent it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETrying to think broadly about probability in the real world, it's much less clear what it is you want to talk about. It's easy to think of the 10 standard things academics know. But the issue is how much more is there, and the standard things are always done by oversimplified models, so in terms of what the mathematics tells you you can actually get money on if the predictions are accurate, it's much harder to find good examples.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the fun things I thought about and got data on is: in what context ordinary people in everyday life think about chance. So that's probably the interesting question. 15 years ago it would have been very hard to think of any way of answering that other than by going and trying to ask people. And then you kind of have the elephant problem. Because if I want to know in what context you think about elephants, somehow it doesn't work to just ask you in what context you think about elephants because A) you don’t know, and B) I sort of put the idea into your mind and that maybe biases it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo to figure out in what context people think about chance, we now have sort of two ways of doing it that we didn't have 15 years ago. First, you can search people's blogs and you see where, on their own initiative, where words of chance come up. So we have some data on that. And also because I spent a year away at Microsoft, the year before the immediate past one. I got someone to give me the file of all the 100,000 queries ever made to the search engine Bing containing the phrase \"chance of\" or \"probability of.” Search engines keep every query they ever made. They are somewhat anonymized, at least in what they gave to me. It wasn't identifying a person Obviously they need that to see how well they’re doing. Google and Bing are sort of interested in where you actually go on the internet after you've typed in a search phrase. Both to make their searches better and because they are selling the advertising. So all of this is kept a record of, somewhat anonymized.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, so you have this data, so you see what people care about. And of course it's very different from what we teach in textbooks on math probability. So it turns out that about half the chance queries have to do with health and medicine broadly, later, and about half of those have to do with birth control and pregnancy, so you know all this stuff is funny because once you see it, you realize what's going on, or at least you guess this is a kind of middle of the night panic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the middle of the night, you actually want to know something because you're going to a search engine rather than something else. Then there are actually sensible questions about cancers. If you are diagnosed with a certain cancer, what are the chances of surviving. So you have sensible questions and you have then totally off the wall questions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAcademics don't do research on this because it's hard to know what the actual bottom line is. So to me it's fascinating to just look at this. It's like looking at a picture, but you don't get tenure thinking about this stuff because what is it could you say about it that would impress anybody? That's kind of the advantage of being old in the academic world. You can do what you like and not care if other people think you're crazy. People sort of think I'm crazy doing this. Always people on the math side, because it's not math. But I don't care.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn a philosophical level, once you start thinking about it, it's very hard to figure out. In some sense, everything interesting about the future is uncertain. You can predict the times of sunrise and sunset in 20 years. But those are boring things. What's going to happen to you and me personally, the state of the world in 20 or 30 years… all the interesting parts of that are uncertain. Yes, sometimes we think in terms of chance and sometimes we don't think in terms of chance. And the more you think about this, the weirder it is.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EYou mention that you see a problem with the everyday claim that the position we are born into is a matter of luck at all. And I thought that was really interesting, something we take for granted.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOh. Ok. You're now getting into the very philosophical, speculative philosophy. People argue endlessly about what, philosophically, what is probability? What does it mean when you say that something has a 70% chance? So there are endless arguments about this sort of stuff. My take is that there has to be a person, an actual person, saying this, or at least a hypothetical observer saying this, for probability to make sense. So even though, in an informal sense, we all say that we're lucky to be born in the West in the 20th century and not in some other place in some other time, the trouble is that then we wouldn't be ourselves. So there isn't actually a person able to make this probability assertion about something that isn't known. So, I'm sort of claiming that things like that don't really make sense, except in some informal sense. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one thing, again, bizarrely, that philosophers do actually attempt to talk seriously about is the simulation idea, which is that… Ok. So we're now backing into weird stuff. In jargon, the Fermi Paradox is that we actually have, we see no evidence of intelligent extraterrestrials with technology. So, the sounding point is just there's no general accepted evidence of any technological extraterrestrials out there. Because, non-technological ones you wouldn't have any evidence of, so that kind of doesn't count. So you now have various explanations of this. And there is a very fun book, actually. It goes through, in a sort of serious and popular way, 50 possible explanations for this. And it comes down to, what it really comes down to, is either the actual evolution of humans or intelligent technological species that happened on earth, maybe this is just such an incredibly unlikely thing to happen that it only happened here. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that's one possibility, which people take seriously. Scientists are predisposed not to like that. Because they don't like\u002Fwant to think of things in terms of unlikely things as having happened. Scientists like to think that well, ok, obviously Earth may be special in some ways but it can't really be that special.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince the universe is a huge place, for that to happen on Earth, there should be something similar happening in other places. So basically it comes down to either Earth is incredibly special or lucky that intelligent life didn’t arise anywhere else or, of course, it did arise somewhere else and we just don't see it. Now you can have great fun speculating on how it might be that there are some technological civilizations out there that we don't see. Pessimists tend to think, well, they just kill themselves off by nuclear war or climate change or whatever the currently perceived threat is. You can have huge numbers of science fictionish ideas. So science fiction itself has lots of ideas about this and scientists have other ideas. And it's all pure speculation. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I was off on a tangent. I was going to get to one of these sort of crazy and philosophical things, which is that most of us think there's some chance of there being more advanced technological civilizations out there. So if you assign any chance except zero to that, you then get the idea that since we can do rather crude virtual reality simulations, they'll be able to do essentially perfect virtual reality simulations of anything they like, of any artificial universe. And again, we can run millions of things, they'll be able run billions of things. So now we have this issue. What we see here could be what we think it is or we could be in a simulation run by extraterrestrials. You now have a math calculation that somebody is trying to do with probability. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESomehow, whatever the probabilities are, because they could be running billions and billions of copies, you could do a sort of hand waving argument that says we are much more likely to be in a simulation than in the real world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, of course arguments like this are of course ridiculous, but the philosophical issue \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nlous, but the philosophical issue is why exactly are they ridiculous? It's less hard to pin down why they're ridiculous. That's something that philosophers do actually think about occasionally. But again, my answer is somehow, in order to think about probabilities, you really need some definite standing point relative to what you know or what you assume. So kind of comparing two different possibilities. In some sense, it's just a more fancy smoke and mirrors version of just asking, how do we know that we are awake and not dreaming? We actually don't. But it just isn't useful to go through life thinking about the possibility that you're just dreaming at the moment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EHow important do you think it is to collaborate with others?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMathematicians have switched, kind of over my lifetime. One could probably look up data, but I'm guessing probably about 25 years ago, they kind of crossed the line. These things happened slowly of course, but before 25 years ago, most math papers would have been single-author, and now it's switched over to most math papers being collaborations. The combination of email and TeX system suddenly made it, on this mundane, practical level of writing and editing, much easier to first write longer papers and collaborate with other people.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI'm a bit of a cynic. Somewhere, I actually have it at work, I have a little fridge magnet with a picture, a sort of cheerful 1950s style housewife saying, \"Drink more coffee, do stupid things faster with more energy.\" So that's actually my metaphor, because it's easier to do this. Things happen more quickly but they tend to be small variants of other stuff. So there's vastly more papers being written. You also have the arXive. People write papers and they immediately post them somewhere without them having gone through peer review or an official publication. So all these things mean that the number written a year has probably gone up by a… I'm exaggerating, probably gone up by a factor of 3 since I started in '79, even though the number of people involved has probably gone up a little but it hasn't gone up so much. So roughly speaking, I think there are twice as many papers per person being written than 30 years ago. But, it's kind of… the average paper is being written twice as much. There aren't twice as many good papers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe because there is more communication. There's some fine line between slightly new ideas and really, really new ideas. That is, an idea comes along, someone has an idea, and if there are fairly natural consequences of it, then in modern life, it takes about 2 years for someone to think of the consequence of someone else's work rather than 1 year. So, on this fairly small and incremental scale, things happen more quickly, but also the really important ideas are the ones that don't just follow from other ideas, they are sort of new thoughts that are not immediate consequences of existing stuff. And somehow the modern technology doesn't do anything to make completely new thoughts come out more quickly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo some extent, it actually mitigates against it because you have all this sort of bustle of activity and you have less of the being able to sort of sit quietly in your study and think about new and different ideas. So I'm a bit of a skeptic about to what extent the modern way of doing things actually makes theoretical knowledge grow. I'm skeptical about the technology actually helping with important new conceptual ideas coming along. I think with anything, with any level of practical development it helps, but with the beginnings of ideas, I think it doesn't help.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ENow, do you find that you or other professors in your community are consulted by politicians in any serious way?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERight. For a typical mathematician, no. I'm in the Statistics Department so people on the statistics side who want to get involved in consulting can do it, and there are various levels. On the governmental level, yes, several of my older colleagues have been involved in this ongoing census adjustment debate. So basically, every 10 years there's a census and every 10 years there's some argument about… we sort of know we're missing 1% of the population and you also have some idea of the types of people that you're missing. So, the answer then is that you can do a statistical adjustment trying to guess as well as you can who you are missing. And of course the words of the Constitution, whatever they are, kind of refer to an actual count. So you have constitutional issues as well as the arguments, of course they are all self-motivated particular arguments. Nothing's of any principle whatsoever. So there's an actual sort of political fight based on political self-interest of the Democrats and Republicans. This fight is sort of disguised as sort of legal and statistical and constitutional arguments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you ask a statistician, in fact one of my friends in England proposed this and of course got shot down, it would work much better to run the census as a sample. The actual idea of trying to count everybody, from a scientific point of view, is a kind of a crazily inefficient way to doing it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003E\n  One of the best rules of statistics is that a smaller amount of good data is much more useful than a lot of bad data.\n\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, making an effort to randomly sample 10% of the population and ask them a lot of questions… it happens at the moment that there is a short form and a long form on the census, but the information on the short form, somehow you don't need to send that to everybody. You can get just as much information if you send it to 10% of the population. And again, with the long form, it's effectively doing this random sampling all over again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, so we are not on the government's radar. Math is so small in the science community. The money in the sciences is kind of in the labs. More than half of science is biology and medicine, so the high school course listing, where people typically said sort of math, physics, chemistry, biology, in that order, kind of has it exactly backwards in size and prominence. All the science is in biology and medicine. Physicists have sort of conned people into supporting their big cyclotrons and things and spending lots of money on that. There's money there. Whether it's the best use of money… like the manned space program is a sort of a vast waste of money… from a scientific point of view.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMath departments are kind of like dentists. People recognize they're necessary so you actually… there is no particular motivation to anyone with a dental school for saying, oh let's save money and close down a dental school or something. So math departments trundle along because sort of everyone just perceives they are part of the background and doesn't pay too much attention to them, mostly. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow things have gotten more interesting. So I say, sort of humorously to my graduate students, that Luke Skywalker only had one dark side to tempt him, but you are going to have 3 dark sides. So, one is hedge funds, of course, all the math finance, or Wall Street. The second one being Microsoft, Google, Facebook, all that world, which uses… Google's based on algorithms, so they are sort of more serious about math than IBM or AT&amp;T were a generation ago. And thirdly, the world's biggest supplier of mathematicians. Can you guess? The National Security Agency. Nobody knows of course, by nature. The NSA has an immense amount of mathematicians doing that. I humorously call them all branches of the evil empire, especially when I was working at Microsoft, of course. (wild laughter) \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EOk. Versus global evil, how can statistics help alleviate global needs? How is it working on a large scale?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, ok. Well, you can try and keep people honest. Right. So, the best, the good side of statistics is to try and actually put good objective data on the table, which politicians in some sense are maybe better than the press makes them out to be. It's easy to have political rhetoric that doesn't pay any attention to actual data. So, talks about taxes and the budget and what the government should spend money on… but you actually need some factual information on what the government \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C\u002Fem\u003E spending money on. And you know, most people have a very bad idea about what the government spends money on. So it's just sort of very… putting actual data up on the wall of a room when you're discussing anything like this is I think the best social service that statisticians can be dealing with. So the positive side is just this sort of boring reminding people of factual information, as a background for whatever arguments they might want to be doing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother book I don't know if you've looked at is \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.randomhousebooks.com\u002Fbooks\u002F176226\u002F\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ETaleb's Black Swan\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which is kind of his, amongst other things, is his very opinionated and fun to read books, whether you agree or disagree with the author. One of his themes is that people have over-sold the ability of mathematics and statistics to predict the future. People make predictions that you don't have any particular reason to believe are right. Historical retrospective analysis shows that people are really bad at predicting many interesting things that they try and predict. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince mathematical and statistics ideas started being developed 100 years ago, the sort of smart people who invented this were perfectly aware of the limitations and perfectly aware that they were sort of doing things that were oversimplified or worked in a particular context but wouldn't work more generally. But when things start getting in textbooks, they kind of get treated like the Ten Commandments. There are things that are not universally true. There's an awful lot of bad academic statistics out there which is kind of not getting the point of…. or sort of based on professional statistics rules for doing things that are only really sensible in rather specific circumstances. So, yeah. The statistics practitioners somewhat over-sold its ability to predict what's going to happen in the future. That's on the bad side of things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhat would you say is on the frontier of math and statistics right now? What's the new big thing or the next big thing? Or is it not like that?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy bit of it isn't like that, I'm afraid… what I do on the technical side… again, too technical to make much sense… one thing I say, what would win you a Nobel Prize, if you could work it out, is to simply ask, again, we're going back to there are lots of math moguls in the stock market… so you actually have data on what the typical daily fluctuation of S&amp;P 500 or whatever your stock index is, and so for mathematicians, you just take that as given. But the scientific question is why are the daily fluctuations of the size they are and not three times bigger or three times smaller? And that's something that no one has any motivation to ask, it won't make you any money. If it's going to make you any money, you would have figured it out. It's like asking why is the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere what it is and not more or less? Scientists never had any reason to think about this until eventually they think about how hot Mars and Venus are. At that point, you realize that Venus is very hot and Mars is rather cold. You say, wait a minute, so why is this happening? And in particular, why is Earth this temperature and not so much hotter or colder? Of course people understand that. Earth, there is a scientific explanation, but the stock market fluctuations, there's this sort of… you have competing stories of rational response to information about the future versus animal spirits, emotion, and momentum, and psychology here. But again, none of these sort of gets to grips with this basic numerical question: why are fluctuations this particular size and not bigger or smaller? So, again, more intellectual questions that nobody knows how to think about.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhat would you have to say about the curriculum [at Cambridge]?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe British system is a bit… it's hard to say the word, but it had more of this long-term air to it. It's a long-term process of learning to do something, rather than the checking off the boxes approach. And in my time, there was still some air, I mean it's probably fading, but the kind of traditional Oxbridge, traditional probably meaning the first half of the 20th century, emphasis was that you spent your mornings working, your afternoons playing manly sports, and your evenings sort of drinking and discussing philosophy. Somehow it just wasn't the engineering nerd idea. So it was somehow this different view of college life. We went to two hours of lectures a day and we did our work for another two hours. The sort of default picture of how much you were working was sort of 4 hours a day. So even the people that worked a lot harder, pretended only to be working for about 4 hours a day. And again, the Cambridge ethos was still that you were actually expected to have intellectual interest outside of your actual courses. It wasn't a trade school. You were going there for intellectual development, and of course the main part of that was actually doing a particular subject like history, but someone who showed no intellectual interests outside their subject, i.e. the engineers, were looked down upon, you know. The engineers were stereotypically regarded in that way, and no one else kind of wanted to be lumped in with the engineers as having no intellectual interests outside their own subject. Yeah, so then you actually had fashions of attending lectures, on architecture, or whatever. So this was, in some sense, I think that it's a lost world. I don't think that it happens in Cambridge anymore. So it was a different atmosphere where people either were or pretended to be or ostentatiously pretended not to be kind of interested in general intellectual things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you're doing philosophy in Cambridge, you'd actually, you'd be doing one thing a week. So you'd go to whatever, as many lectures as you cared about, but your only actual duty was to write one essay a week, and then go on to a professor's study and have to sort of read out, you'd basically have to read out your essay to them and have them comment on it. It's both, it's good. It's labor intensive and maybe not an economically viable system. But firstly, you can't bullshit. American students will try and write essays on bullshit, but if you actually know you have to read it out to the professor, you know you can't bullshit. You can't talk about things you don't really understand, because if you do, you're going to get a question about them. So, on the humanities side, a good system. It's a good system for producing future professors. On the math side, the math was kind of right or wrong, so then the personalized feedback was less useful somehow, but it worked anyway.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy theory is if you were setting up a colony on Mars, you'd choose something very different. If you're starting with a blank slate, you'd choose some very different educational system from the one we have now in many ways. Whether it would be better or not is a different question. So far, universities have segued from finishing school for the few to something you want 50% or more than 50% of the population to go through. And there's just this vagueness about what universities are supposed to be doing. If you really write down what you want universities to do, it's very hard to figure out. The view, there is a clear notion of technical training for a particular profession, and mostly of course, universities don't do that. Pre-med or pre-law, they're not… the professional schools are doing that but universities are not, and if you have an idealistic view of general intellectual capabilities… but to me, the connection between the system of teaching a course on a subject as a self-contained entity, the connection of this to any conceptual assertion about what universities should be doing just isn't so clear to me. So you can teach people about anything from medieval history to evolutionary biology. People are reasonably smart, intelligent. They can learn it and pass an exam on it. But then the issue is, what's the cumulative effect of 32 of these courses? And to what extent the cumulative effect of what actually happens corresponds to any articulation of what you want to have happened just isn't clear to me. Maybe it's just mathematicians liking things in more black and white. But I kind of think that universities are what they are because of some historical evolution, and again, I think if you were trying to start off with a blank sheet of paper and think of what do we want to do with people between the ages of 18 and 22, I guess I don't think you'd come up with the modern university. Who knows. The cynical view is that we don't actually have… you have the economy organized so there aren't actually jobs for these people. It's keeping them out of the job force.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo, it doesn't sound like you think there's any duty to learn.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI'm more thinking about the big picture. You take courses and you learn stuff, but then the issue is in order to think about what you should be learning… are you judging this by sort of practical issues, or by tangible practical issues, or getting a job or things you are going to use somehow later in life, are you judging it as sort of developing intellectual curiosity, developing knowledge for its own sake? There's just, in my mind, some sort of incoherent mixture of these things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a sense in which people who teach medieval history, I think, are conscious of the fact that most of the people taking their classes aren't going to go on to be academics doing medieval history. There is some sort of a general intellectual interest reason you are teaching this. Mathematicians, I think, are sort of less consciously aware of it. Or they are consciously aware of it but they sort of don't take note of it. Mathematicians tend to teach undergraduate math as a logical prerequisite to graduate math, which is a logical prerequsite to teaching math. And they do this sort of automatically without thinking that most of our undergraduate math majors aren't going to become mathematicians, and so what should we be teaching them with that in mind? And colleagues are very reluctant to start thinking along those lines, partly because they have no idea where it'll lead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EThat's kind of radical.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell… with me, I just like a clear alternative presented by students. The other thing about students is… why are undergraduates actually at Berkeley? So there's a kind of switch. If you ask somebody who's in law school or in med school why they're there, they'll answer that with, “Well, I want to grow up to be a lawyer,” the obvious reason. But they actually have some definite reason. If you ask someone in high school, the right answer is, “Duh.” You know? They have to be in high school. It's just part of the system. So where does undergraduate school fit in this scale? I think, for most of Berkeley students, it's this “Duh” answer. Mostly they're there because that's part of the system. They were good in high school, and everyone expected them to go on to a good college, and Berkeley was a good college.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I occasionally… it's not my job to grill students about these things in office hours but occasionally I do anyway. Yeah. That's my impression. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003E\n  They might have thought about Berkeley rather than some other college, but none of them have ever thought about whether or not to go to college.\n\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt's just sort of a natural progression: they're there because it's the thing to do. Whereas in my time only 10% went to university at all. And if 1% are going to Oxford or Cambridge, then I think there was more of a definite reason. It was more like med school and law school, nowadays. Again, if you go to law school, you actually at least think you have some interest in doing it. You don't actually have to have an interest in anything to go to Berkeley. You have to declare a major eventually, but your first two years, you can just go there because you're academically good. So people are just going with the flow. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ENow, how competitive do you think it is, in your career and academia? Is it fairly altruistic, and harmonious, and civil?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople worry about getting tenure. And again, people worry much more than they \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nshould. Some of the Ivy League places basically have a policy of never giving anyone tenure, but you kind of know that when you go. So, it's kind of… unless you have some totally unrealistic assessment either way of your abilities, you kind of mostly you know if you're going to get tenure or not. So people stress about it unduly. Yeah, once you're established, generally there is some feedback. At the research level, people who are motivated by research get to go on doing it. And, by the time you get to mid-career, you either have gotten enough positive feedback and appreciation from people and invitations to give talks at conferences, etcetera. If you get a lot of those, you are happy with your career, but if you don't get those, then you are unhappy and feeling unappreciated, at which point most people kind of just taper off and go on to do other things. So by and large, it's somehow self-regulating in some modest way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course the lab sciences now have this terrible situation whereby once you've made a reputation young, once you get to mid-career, you're running a lab which means you spend all your time writing proposals to get money. You're unlikely doing any of the science. Your post-docs are doing all the actual science. So this is kind of a, you know, a terrible system… it's kind of a crazy way of doing things. But anyway, math is a totally different world. Partly because mathematicians don't actually need money. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the humanities, of course, as you know, there isn't any money. Somehow, you kind of have… there's some sort of different form of competitiveness. The Little Miss Sunshine Second Best Proust Scholar… you have the personal competition there, which is, according to the stereotype, more prevalent in the humanities than in the sciences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA minor fun thing… I'm in the Royal Society of the British Scientific Society. So, you have to imagine the Hogwarts book of spells, this sort of giant thick book with the old leather bindings, and every 50 years they take off the cover, put in 50 blank pages and seal it up again into a thicker book. And each year, the new fellows get to sign their name in there. So you get to sign your name in the same book that Isaac Newton and King Charles II and every other scientist you ever heard of has signed in. That's cool. It really is. It gives you this sort of sense of tradition. I often say that not one person in a hundred knows who the CEO of the world's largest corporation is. In one sense they're important, but nobody has any idea who they actually are now. Scientists have some hope of fame. They've heard of Isaac Newton.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo, along that line, what purpose do you think it serves, this tradition of giving awards and receiving them, and how is that important in the academic community?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, that's a good question. There's this wonderful book. I don't know if you've ever read the book \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.simonandschuster.com\u002Fbooks\u002FBobos-in-Paradise\u002FDavid-Brooks\u002F9780684853789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003EBobos in Paradise\u003C\u002Fa\u003E?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EOh, I love it.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere you are. It's wonderful. And the academic things are so accurate. There's a page there on awards. And it's exactly right, and it's appropriate to me cuz I actually run one of the main awards in my subject via some weird chain of coincidence. There was a professor, Professor Loève, who had been at Berkeley for many years and died just before I came in ‘79, and I in fact thereby inherited his office because nobody wants to move all their books. So, I'm in his office. He had a long and happy marriage based on him being in Berkeley and her being in Paris. They were French. He went back in the summer. So he died and around 1990, his widow was diagnosed with cancer and given a year to live, and decided… in England and America you can write a will and leave your money to whoever you like. In France, this is very hard. There's this Napoleonic Code, it's basically kind of expected that you leave your money to your children, etcetera. Even if you write a will saying no, they can challenge it. So she didn't get on with her son, so she decided she'd leave money to us in Berkeley, but because of this legal aspect she had to kind of physically get rid of the money before she died, so it wouldn't do him any good to contest the will after she died. So yeah, she gave us a million dollars, half of which is sort of supporting graduate fellowships and half of which is, again, establishing a prize in our subject.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd bizarrely enough, I was the first winner of this prize in '93. So then the guy running it, another French man, somehow devolved upon me without… it's actually there are some legal authorities administered by the Berkeley administration. Anyway, regardless of any legal niceties, I run it, and I'm firmly of the opinion that anything that can be run by one person should be, rather by committee. So I don't actually, I don't choose the winner, but I sort of basically appoint a committee of people to vote on a winner. I sort of behave totally dictatorially. I say, you're gonna do this. I tell them, I want you to vote on this, and I don't want you to argue. Anyone who argues, a one strike rule, anyone who argues or doesn't follow instructions is thrown off the committee and not used again. (wild laughter) It works well. I just think this works better than any other system.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know, the other thing is, there's once every four years a worldwide international congress of mathematicians, which is sort of the real big deal. And being one of the main… where they both give the Fields Medals and Nobel Prizes, as well as just being invited to be a main speaker there is a big thing. But that's done by committee, and somehow it's a sort of a painful process and you have committees saying, well, isn't it this person's turn or you didn't pick enough people from that country. Somehow it's a very tedious thing to be involved with. It never comes up with the right…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003E\n  there's this old line about the camel being a horse designed by a committee.\n\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, what the committee comes up with is worse than what any individual person would have come up with, because of the compromises.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERight, so there's a kind of competitive issue here. So there's a dean of physical sciences, so math, and stats, and physics, and astronomy, and earth sciences, so he has five or six departments in him. And if now he sees that people in some of these departments are sort of getting lots of prizes and awards and others are not, then there is somehow a natural reaction on his part just to sort of say, these are doing well, so I've got more money and resources for them. The point is that there may be more prizes and awards in those subjects. So, for a discipline like math, somehow the more awards and prizes there are in math, again, it may sort of devalue their worth within math, but it sort of increases the prominence and visibility of math to deans or to other people that are comparing departments. It kind of looks good on your website when you say our faculty has won these awards, etcetera. I just had a fight with our people about how much of this stuff we should be self-promoting on our website. I don't believe in all this, so I don't like too much of this stuff. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes within a department. Because in the math department, math divides itself into 3 or 10 or 100 subfields, depending on how finely you want to divide it. But when there is a job up, there will maybe be three serious candidates in different subfields, and there is some argument about which one to hire, and now again if one has won a prize and one hasn't, it's hard to say that that has no effect, but again it may just be because there is a prize in this subfield and there isn't a prize in that subfield. So, again, there is competition between subfields. There's an advantage in having prizes. So they exist partly as competitive necessity and partly it's sort of nice to honor people. It's kind of an excuse to honor people, partly it's making people feel good.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EDo they practice affirmative action at Berkeley? If it's a matter of public record…\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy sarcastic view is that… it's kind of like the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity, God is one and God is three at the same time, so we both do and both don't, we simultaneously do and don't. You know that you have somewhat conflicting federal and state laws on this sort of thing. California has state laws that sort of prohibit consideration of race and gender in hiring, but affirmative action laws at the federal level are saying something subtly different, that you have to make a positive effort to kind of make sure that women and minorities are in the pool of candidates that you are actually considering. So there's a tension here. You know, most of the mathematicians are a bit cynical. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Soviet Russia, you had to pay lip service in Marxist-Leninism when you were teaching mathematics and people paid to have lip service, their dean told them to, and ignored it the rest of the time, but… so there's a cynical view that there is always some sort of tax from society on political correctness that you need to pay attention to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut putting aside the cynical view, here's the bottom line. There are the various cultural pressures we all recognize that traditionally have reduced the number of women and minorities in math and science. Almost nobody objects to the principle of trying to counteract these pressures, but it's the bureaucratic hassles involved in conforming to rules that create the cynicism. In my Stat department, we have maybe 5 out of 20-odd faculty being women, and they're all perceived as having been hired on merit, not because of affirmative action. As for minorities, at the faculty level there are so few that it's not on the radar.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo what's ahead of you? What would you like to do before you retire? Do you think in those terms?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI'm getting old and slow. I'm conscious of it. No, until very recently I had a very firm mental image of myself as 29. Yeah, so I have some technical projects, again along this line. I like to think about things that no one else in the world is thinking about. I don't think I mentioned that before, but yes, my research style since I was young is this sort of intellectual curiosity style, so instead of working in fields that other people are working in, it's more fun to try and create your own little idea, these are very little fields of course. So some of the things I've worked on, one of the initiators of, have become little fields within math probability. It's just more fun to do that, so I have a couple of projects along those lines. I sort of just say, here are an interesting set of ideas just to think about, the first interesting thing to go on in the area and then encourage other people to work on it. It's more fun to have minions doing your actual work here. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the probability in the real world stuff is sort of more what… I humorously started referring to this as my retirement project when I wasn't thinking of retirement at all. Now, I'm getting… now I'm no longer 29 and retirement is a little more than a vague theoretical possibility.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah. So it's sort of writing that up and putting it out there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",quote:"\"In some sense, everything interesting about the future is uncertain.

And that's a long time ago by now. That was in '87. I'm surprised that I'm still alive anyway. And my critique of viral AIDS was in good faith. It was not because I hated somebody or I’m a mass murderer and all this kind of thing. It was just basic science. There are some very profound problems with this idea that AIDS is a viral epidemic, sexually transmitted epidemic. Where is it? 28 years later. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis virus can not be found in people with AIDS, even when they're dying from AIDS. Only the antibody against it. For all other viruses – no exceptions, none – if the antibody is there, the virus is not doing anything. That's why vaccines work so well. They prevent the virus from getting into another cell. When the antibody is there, you cannot die from the virus, because the virus cannot be found. They can't find it. They need the polymerase chain reaction to detect traces of viral nucleic acid, because this is a method that finds a needle in a haystack. But you are not dying from a needle in a haystack. There are lots of holes in this virus-AIDS hypothesis. There are too many. Well, there are only holes in it. Often I don't see anything else.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll new pathogenic microbes cause exponential epidemics. The population gets sick exponentially, within weeks lots of people die. Then, the remainder of the population either becomes immune, through their own immunity or a vaccine if you have one, and then the epidemic disappears. So the history of microbial epidemics, viral, bacterial, or others has always been more or less the same over time. It goes up exponentially and comes down exponentially. And the classical example is the flu epidemic of 1918 in which more people died than in WWI. That's 20 million people within a couple of months. Up and down and gone it was.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut typically, the microbes claim only a couple of million of your cells to replicate without causing a disease. In some cases you get sick and in very rare cases you die. So AIDS was said to be an exception. We’re all going to die from this new virus; the population is going to be decimated. We have a new sexually transmitted virus coming from Africa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut now, 27 years later, there is no general, heterosexual AIDS epidemic anywhere on this planet. Not in the great USA, not in Europe, not in Africa, not in India, not in Asia, nowhere. And sex has not changed a lot in the past 20 years. It's been the same since God invented it millions of years ago. As a result of unprotected sex, four and a half million babies are born in the U.S. every year, and have been born before AIDS and continue to be born, and there is no devastating AIDS epidemic among heterosexuals and babies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo the numbers are just not adding up.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are not adding up at all. The germ theory says the numbers go up exponentially and soon after come down exponentially. That's how it should go. The numbers don't add. The AIDS establishment is more silent about it. They don't say much about this anymore. They keep assuring you, you must drugs or else you die, but they don't discuss anymore that it's supposed to kill everybody and spread exponentially. They are more and more quiet about this now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, so I think that there are big open questions. Nevertheless, I became the official villain responsible for everything that didn't work out in AIDS, because I advised people to ignore the virus and not to take anti-viral drugs, and now I don't get grants and students as a result of that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo more research funds. So, I focused again on cancer which was my expertise and my interest anyway. When I first came to this country, in the sixties, the virus-cancer theory was the prevailing cancer theory. I worked then with Wendell Stanley who got the first Nobel Prize in viruses, tobacco mosaic virus. That new building next door was named after him. He was the first Nobel-virologist, and he said you can come to work with me on cancer viruses as a post-doc. The whole institute was essentially working with him, and he said the hottest thing nowadays is tumor viruses. If we can nail that down, we will make a vaccine and cancer is conquered. And that would be a big goal. A lot of people were pushing this goal at that time. So I was working on so-called retroviruses, viruses that might cause cancer because they don't kill cells.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the virus-cancer theory didn't work out two decades later – some cancer virologists said, well, a retrovirus could at least cause AIDS. That's still important. It's not as good as cancer, but it's better than nothing. So they pushed that one. I said, well, there are problems with that too. And then I became a persona non grata for pointing out the many problems with the virus-AIDS hypothesis. No more grants, no more students, no more invited lectures – those were the immediate consequences. Ok. I said, if it's not a virus, then other things must explain AIDS and cancer. So I set out to find those other things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWell then, how harmless is HIV, do you think?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it does nothing.

At least if you can trust those estimates that the Center for Disease Control and U.N. AIDS keeps publishing. Like 30-40% of the population in South Africa, or in Africa altogether are positive. And that population has doubled in the last 25 years. That's not so bad, huh? You could say that HIV has doubled the African population. If you can replicate and procreate – despite HIV, that's not a bad sign. At the same time, they say this virus is deadly, the worst we've ever seen or we ever had.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEven in the U.S. we have 1 million HIV positives at any given time since we can test for it in '85. Now 26 years later, it's still a million. That looks like a stable population to me. We have 30,000 AIDS patients, but 30,000 out of a million is only 3%, is it? Yeah. It's not a whole lot. The normal mortality is 1.5% - 2%. And those 30,000 include all these so-called \"AIDS risk groups,\" when you look up who is dying among those millions. It's not some antibody positive who didn't know before. It's typically one from these risk groups, which are intravenous drug users, or male homosexuals who advertise thousands of dates and use tons of chemicals to make this possible. These chemicals include cocaine, the amphetamines, the nitrite inhalants, and then come the anti-viral drugs, which are chemotherapies to get over the so-called HIV risk.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are much better off on illicit amphetamines, and cocaine, and heroin then you are on anti-viral drugs. The primary anti-viral drugs are DNA chain terminators, which were originally designed to kill human cells for cancer therapy – not to treat harmless viruses like HIV.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESee, most viruses, the majority of the viruses we know in humans and in animals are cytotoxic, meaning they kill cells in which they replicate. They kill typically a few 1,000 cells, enough for them to survive, when the immune system stops them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the retrovirus are so harmless, literally harmless because they do not kill cells for their survival. Moreover, they are typically latent or inert in contrast to all pathogenic viruses. They become genetic residents of the cell, if you want to call them a name. They are in there like your in-laws moving into your house. They are a nuisance but they are not killing you. And this is how the retroviruses are, and that is why they are, in theory at least, potential cancer viruses. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is for this reason that we studied them very carefully as so-called possible cancer viruses – because they don’t kill cells like lytic viruses, such as measles, or mumps, or polio. So if a virus kills a cell, it can't become a cancer cell, but a retrovirus is one that never kills the cell. We retrovirologists kept saying that to each other. We were the leading virologists in the ‘70s and the ‘80s for that implied reason. I was one of them. I was the blue-eyed boy in the field. I had every grant I wanted. We studied these special viruses that don't kill the cell and therefore could be the cause of cancer, and in this work I found that one of them contained a gene that caused a tumor, the so-called oncogene. This gene actually makes the cells grow faster, or hyperplastic – but these hyperplastic cells are not really cancer cells yet, and such a virus was never found in humans. That is consistent with the fact that human and even animal cancers are not contagious. The \"tumor viruses” nevertheless helped us to later find that chromosomal rearrangements are the immediate precursors of cancer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo why did everyone get so alarmed about the HIV virus? What happened to create this?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, because they were desperate to find a cause and a corresponding treatment for AIDS. There was pressure to find something. Again, the CDC was always hyping up a new scare, a new panic. The CDC was built up as a military unit initially in WWII and they didn't want to shrink down after WWII. In fact, they wanted to expand, so they had to invent one problem after another. And I think their last semi-hit was the polio epidemic of the ‘50s. Since then, there is nothing really, nothing that they can claim. Nevertheless, they come up with one scare story after another. All these flu epidemics are not happening, AIDS isn't a true viral epidemic either.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003E\n  The writer John Rappaport, from Los Angeles, used to call it \"science by press release.” \n\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMargaret Heckler, the Secretary of Health and cancer researcher Robert Gallo from the National Institiutes of Health announced by press release in Washington in April 1984 that the cause of AIDS had been found. But at that time there was no publication yet, no paper, nothing, except a speculative paper from 1983 by the French virologist Luc Montagnier. Montagnier's paper was not considered, taken serious at the time. That was before that press conference in ’84.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy? In 1984 Reagan needed badly something to build up his reelection campaign. He hadn't talked about AIDS and he was probably too \"homophobe\" at the time. Maybe he talked to John Wayne about it but not to the public. I am paraphrasing now freely, but they probably told him that he needs to say something about AIDS because it looks bad with the votes. He needed the New York Times, needed Liz Taylor, and Rock Hudson, and the left votes. So he apparently tried, they tried to find something for him. So he picked up Gallo. I mean, that's at least what I heard related. He asked, is there any hope? They said, yes, Gallo is the man that found the virus, and once we have a virus, we'll have a vaccine. Don't worry. In two years, it’s all over. The New York Times jumped at it. And Liz Taylor loved it. And Mathilda Krim loved it. And founded AMFAR [The American Foundation for AIDS Research], and then Ronald Reagan was reelected. Bob Gallo from the National Institutes of Health found the virus, and Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health, promised a vaccine, so now the machine was running and the millions were flowing. That was a pivotal time, in that respect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the machine was rolling, ever since. At least in medical history, it was a unique public relations job getting everyone engaged. “We are all in this together” from Liz Taylor to even Ronald Reagan, reluctantly I think though. “Pro gay jogging, gay marching, gay advertising,” anything. Patients never had a voice before. All these actors wore the purple ribbon. Even at the Oscars, they were wearing them, most of them. That started with AIDS, purple. It's not so in anymore, but it was like the American flag on the president now. Even some of the politically correct professors, heterosexuals were joining in. “We're all in this together,” that was the slogan. There's lots of propaganda.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, how could HIV cause a fatal disease? They never answered that question. They left it always open. Yeah, they said, we don't know yet, we'll find the mechanism. But the reality is that no global sexually transmitted epidemic ever materialized. It stayed in these very few rare risk groups.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet there was a very strong alternative explanation, which they don't want to hear about, namely recreational drugs. In the ‘70s and ‘80s, everybody was on drugs. It's a lifestyle, but they don't want to say it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EA drug lifestyle is politically incorrect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENobody should be blamed. Viruses you can't blame, that's like blaming God, you know, but lifestyle or sexual persuasions is another matter – you're homophobe, or you're against a minority, against blacks, Africans, God knows what. Viruses are politically correct, so we can deal with them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is the biggest windfall for pharma-companies ever. It was chemotherapy for the rest of your life! And chemotherapy is very expensive. I think it's now a 5 billion or 8 billion dollar market for AIDS drugs, so they don't want to hear that HIV doesn't need to be treated. See what I mean? It's a horrible market.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo it's a phenomenon where the treatment may be more harmful than the symptoms?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, for sure. The treatment for AIDS is essentially a lifetime prescription of chemotherapy. It's truly horrible. The only thing they have done – if you want to call it an improvement – is making it less toxic. They lowered doses over time because people were dying pretty fast on the original doses. And what do they give? They give you drugs, like AZT, that were developed for cancer chemotherapy, developed to kill your own cells. AZT is a DNA chain terminator, a drug designed to stop DNA synthesis in the cell. When that happens, the cell goes. And that was developed to, quote, “cure cancer.” That is cancer chemotherapy. As I said, even that is not exactly God's invention.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ECan you describe, what happened when you came out with this book, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.goodreads.com\u002Fbook\u002Fshow\u002F79375.Inventing_the_AIDS_Virus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003EInventing the AIDS Virus\u003C\u002Fa\u003E?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.goodreads.com\u002Fbook\u002Fshow\u002F79375.Inventing_the_AIDS_Virus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003EInventing the AIDS Virus\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

I was described as a “lone dissenter,” always the only one. They want to isolate you to zero. But there are literally hundreds or thousands of them who question it. You know the control is so tight. We had a paper on this African issue, two years ago now. It was a response to a challenge from a colleague from Harvard, Max Essex is his name. They were charging us, and me personally, as \"mass murderers.” The word is printed in \u003Cem\u003EDiscover Magazine\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, because I and the president Mbeki from South Africa questioned the merits of these anti-viral drugs for the same reason we talked about now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe virus is very unlikely causing it, and if so, these drugs are not even depressing the virus anyway. Essex estimated 1.8 million South Africans, of South Africa, the state South Africa died from 2000 – 2005 and that was my doing and Mbeki's doing, and I would be a mass murderer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I responded with the argument that the reality is that the population during that same time increased by 3 million. And then they responded sort of indirectly: well, there would have 4.8 million if you hadn't knocked out the 1.8. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the population explodes, hardly anybody would say, well, couldn't it explode even more if it weren't for some microbe that I'm going to discover? No. It's kind of an odd situation. Since the population gained 3, but they have never been able to show that HIV does something. In tissue culture, you put the virus into human cells, they do not die, just like all other retroviruses in infected cells.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut there came anonymous letters to the university last year, that in the interests of public health, I should be investigated for some misconduct, meaning up to and possibly losing the job or some censure like being degraded or limiting teaching. But half a year later, they couldn't find any evidence, and I was exonerated. They didn't like that either. But the paper we published against Essex is gone. The paper was withdrawn by Elsevier, the publisher, at the request of anonymous \"HIV researchers.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt's a big big publisher, and they don't want to be criticized by mainstream scientists because they need the publications. If they had taken a stand, essentially for me, that this should stay if it's not refuted, they would have been under lots of pressure from the AIDS researchers who might say, we don't want to publish with you, you're supporting a mass murderer. So, Elsevier followed suit and took the paper. I'm exonerated, but the paper is not back. The rumors still continue. I cannot show up and say here is my paper. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhen would it have been published?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2009. It was already there. I have it on my desktop… quite a few people have it. And they can’t stop it. It’s still in the so-called DOI file or somewhere. It’s semi-extinguishable. They do it subtly now. Typically, they send it to a so-called peer reviewer, meaning somebody who is in the establishment already and knows what to do with it. It’s sort of essentially abortion. Reviewers typically kill it before publication. This can be done secretly. It’s anonymous. Typically, with peer review, you don’t have to put your name. They say, well, this is risky, and can dump on it without having to sign and give enough reasons. Typically, the editor and the editorial board know this is not good for them, so they say, too bad, we cannot publish your paper. But this time it slipped through, and it was already in their journal. Now they couldn’t do this anymore. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhat was it called?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMedical Hypotheses\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, the journal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhat was your essay called?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I have published along these lines before, but this one was called \u003Cem\u003EHIV-AIDS hypothesis out of touch with South African AIDS — A new perspective\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. I focused it on Africa a long time ago, but the whole continent is covered in it, \u003Cem\u003EA new perspective\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. It was relatively clear, what I was saying. I think it was the emperor’s new clothes that killed it. The major charge was that I had killed 1.8 million when there were 3 million more. I think they even didn’t know. They didn’t check. They may have checked, but nobody ever mentioned these numbers. So we checked. It’s not a secret. Really. You can go to the website of the U.S. Census Bureau and they say exactly what the populations are. They have national and international tables. They keep tabs. I think it’s part of national security because they want to know how many people there are per country to know what would happen in a war: how much food they need, how much ammunition they need, and what the national social product is going to be, for that purpose. The U.S. keeps very good numbers on that. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EThat was one of my questions. Are you debating the interpretation of the facts or are the facts themselves in question? It sounds like it is a little bit of both.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, I would definitely first take the quoted fact that people were lost in this country. That’s just a matter of looking at facts, not interpretation. Sure, the interpretation comes next. They interpreted an assumed loss of 1.8 million, without mentioning the gain of 3 million.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESee \u003Cem\u003EMedical Hypothesis\u003C\u002Fem\u003E was founded by Horrobin. He’s a British biochemist. He said exactly what I’m saying. This whole thing with reviewing papers before they get pub lished by the peers is a completely incestuous process, because those who are getting to review grant applications and papers usually \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C\u002Fem\u003E the current establishment, the mainstream establishment. I was part of it myself before I questioned the HIV hypothesis. We were reviewing grant applications and papers. It’s easy enough to filter out someone who is totally nuts, and says it’s Chinese tea or something like that, but if there is someone who is threatening your own investment, someone who says, for instance, that cancer is caused by chromosomes, or carcinogens, or lifestyle, that it has nothing to do with viruses, we would have done away with it, because it would have been threatening our own investments, our awards and chances to get grants and stay in business. It’s a biological thing. It’s self-interest, I think. You tend to take care of yourself first. It doesn’t mean that you are a bad guy, but you may not see other points so easily. You have to work on it, to be tolerant enough. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, this is why this journal \u003Cem\u003EMedical Hypotheses\u003C\u002Fem\u003E came up. [Horrobin] said the bias is so obvious in this peer review system. You send in an AIDS paper anywhere in America, I would say anywhere in the Western world by now, that questions HIV, and it will not be accepted.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was essentially the only chance left, this \u003Cem\u003EMedical Hypotheses\u003C\u002Fem\u003E journal, that I know. And that’s a well established journal, but it’s clearly a minority journal. It’s like an outsider’s journal. But they stated, we don’t give it to peers who have an inherent conflict of interest, who want to defend their field. And beyond just criticizing their competition, they would not want to have something published that gives a new perspective on AIDS when they all have worked on AIDS and want to work on HIV and make a career on HIV.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESounds like the way microbes operate.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that’s exactly right. They said we have this journal without the conventional peer review, oh, that’s the problem. They not only took out our paper, they fired the editor in chief. He’s gone. He’s a professor from Newcastle University, and he was the successor of the editor in chief who died a few years earlier. He is British professor of science and history, perfectly suited for the job, but they fired him because he would not agree to install conventional peer review, where the guys in the field are judging. It’s like having General Motors or Volkswagen review all of the new cars… \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EThere’s not really a better option, is there?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe said, we’ll publish it if it’s consistent — we have our own reviewers. If it’s logical, there it is. Everybody can attack it or reject it once it’s published. We are not protecting this paper against reasonable attacks. So they certainly knew \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nthat they could answer the charge, but they chose to go to Elsevier, the publisher, a huge publishing house, and said, close down the journal, it’s a world public health risk, what our critics are doing now. Most of them were anonymous but one of them was Barré-Sinoussi, who shared the Nobel Prize on HIV with Montagnier, according to an editorial in \u003Cem\u003EScience\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.

They took out an Italian AIDS paper which was published at the same time, also questioning AIDS to some degree, which I didn’t know about at the same time, and the editorial board was fired too. In other words, they’d have experts re viewing who have their own career made in, let’s say, in cancer, it would be in mutations, or in AIDS it would be HIV. And that’s a terrible, unfortunately, a terrible situation. I think it’s bad for American science and science in general.

It sometimes gets you down in the foggy morning. Here you try your best, at least you think, to say what’s really going on. And AIDS would be preventable, by banning or not taking drugs—not like cancer, where I say maybe we have the truth but it’s not going to be a picnic. With AIDS, it could be a stroke of a pen and AIDS would be gone. You could stop the anti-viral treatments, which are AIDS by prescription. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are toxic. They are designed that way. It’s not a side effect. That’s what they were designed to do, kill cells. And that’s what they do. And that’s going to kill people. It’s just a matter of time, how much you take. \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nAlso, you could make a lot of progress if you told the kids, maybe now they don’t even know much about AIDS anymore, but 10 years ago, if you take all these drugs, amphetamines, cocaine or heroin that’s going to give you AIDS, not some date or some mate. That would probably be one of the more effective weapons in the war on drugs. I think if they had a choice, many of them would probably stop using these things. I think they need to impress each other with big numbers, but I think if they knew that these poppers were toxic, they would think it over. Most of them I know actually suspect it anyway. That it’s not the virus or certainly not only the virus. If we tell them clearly, it’s not your sex. Sex is not new like AIDS. \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nBut what’s new in our society, our population, our time, is the availability of all these psychoactive drugs, the horrible anti-viral drugs and the combination of them. That’s inevitably what’s associated with AIDS patients in Europe and the U.S. or the so-called Western world. In Africa, it’s poverty and not much is happening anyway. It’s [the population] exploding, not disappearing. So to make that clear and ban the use, the sale even of anti-viral drugs, would essentially eliminate AIDS. But not with cancer. That would be more difficult. Even there, for anything to happen scientifically, you need a theory. You need a rational theory that is testable to find out what cancer is really all about, rather than guessing around.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EBut we cure, cure, cure.

They are not fatal period. Other factors could be involved. But I mean, you could have that virus and be shot by a gun. And you’d be done. But they don’t have anything causally to do with each other. They are by themselves, harmless. If you have a car accident, too bad, but the virus is not the cause of that. It could happen with or without the virus.

They try to make it co-factors. If they are in a corner with the virus not doing much, well it’s a co-factor for something. They say, this plus something else. But then we have to know exactly what plus something else is. And I tell you what the plus something else is. I know they don’t need the virus. You can give them an antiviral drug, which is a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. It doesn’t need HIV to terminate DNA. And the same thing with the so-called i.v. drug users. \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nWhat about the long latent period? Well the long latent period, ten years or five years—that’s the time it takes from starting to inject drugs to ending up in People’s Park or going in the hospital with pneumonia. Yes, that’s what it is. You’re not getting AIDS from injecting drugs even for 10 or 20 parties, but then it gets a bit worse over time. If you have no time to do anything else, and if you run out of money to pay for it, can’t pay the rent, can’t take a shower, can’t get new underwear, and start smelling and rotting in the park, then you end up in the hospital. They say, poor guy, you have HIV. Take a shower, we’ll give you anti-viral drugs. That’s even worse.

But if they looked at the numbers, they would see very fast that it doesn’t fit. We have a million HIV positives since 1985. And where are they? There’s still a million HIV positives now. Why didn’t they die out from HIV? They say, oh, this has a long latent period. What does that mean? The virus replicates in 24 hours. There is no long latent period for any virus whatsoever. The latent period is the time it needs to get into the cell, replicate, and get out. And that’s totally timed by the cell. It doesn’t have its own machine. It works exactly with the cell. So, there is no explanation for these long latent time periods. The latent periods are…that’s how long it takes when you have a certain lifestyle to wear yourself down. Even if it was the best lifestyle, you were out at the end of 80 years or 90 years, but with these drugs, you burn up your credits faster.

He wrote the introduction to this book \u003Cem\u003EInventing the AIDS Virus\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. It’s a funny story in a way. Here is a Nobel prize winner, looking for a paper that proves HIV is causing AIDS and has not been able to find it. Great scientist. Good enough to invent polymerase chain reaction.

And he talked to him, and immediately Montagnier looked how to escape. So where is the paper?, he said. The CDC. What? The CDC? You got the Nobel Prize for it. Don’t you have a paper that proves it? Well, uh, then he’s running away. He says, he was running away faster than he could follow him for his Nobel Prize winning discovery. That’s the first time he’s seen a scientist doing this. Typically, they can’t get enough of saying what they have done and how they can prove it, and he was running away all the time. So, from then on, he joined me and invited me for a meeting down there, and he wrote the introduction to the book, the foreword. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhat year was that published?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1996. I know. It seems kind of old, but the irony is, when I read it recently. Exactly the same problems are still around, and all of the predictions, everyone of them in there I think proved to be right: that the drugs wouldn’t cure, a vaccine would not be found. You know Edward Jenner was the country doctor who invented vaccination. It’s called vaccination because he found that pox occur in cows also. The Latin word for cow is vacca. So he took an extract from the cow that had recovered from the pox and thought maybe that protects other people too. And apparently, they say, he tried it on his kid. Inoculated some extract in the kid and several others too, and they didn’t get pox virus. And he deduced this must work on other people and succeeded in inoculating other people with it. So he discovered the principle of vaccination, that an infection induces something that protects against a new infection, that’s the antibody, and he essentially designed the first vaccine against pox virus which is still used today. That was 200 years ago. He got 30 pounds from the English government and developed it with his son in his practice in 6 months. And here is the most sophisticated, advanced, affluent, everything America, we \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Eare working now since 1984 on a vaccine against HIV.

Because you can’t have a vaccine against a disease that isn’t caused by a virus. You can have a vaccine, but it won’t protect you against the disease that’s not caused by the virus. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll viruses strike before immunity strikes back. They are essentially doing a blitzkrieg. They attack fast, before you can defend yourself. That’s their only chance. For flu, for measles, for mumps. They cause lesions or fever or sometimes even death, but rarely that. In the meantime, your immune system catches up. And that’s a matter of days. It’s very fast, the immune system. It’s not waiting. It better not. Otherwise, you would be gone. And the virus grows exponentially and the immune system, at the same rate, sometime even faster, makes B Cells and T Cells. And within 3 or 4 days typically, the immune system catches up and the virus is blocked. The antibodies block it. And then the disease ends.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is not one example, not one that I know of from studying viruses for over 20 years, that a virus causes a disease years after it is neutralized. That’s completely absurd. I mean, not only paradox, I think it’s truly absurd. There’s no logic behind it. It’s only trying to connect some thing that one likes to be the cause, like HIV, with something that happens 5 or 10 years later. There is absolutely nothing there to link the two events, except a hypothesis. And they have tried very hard. They still do when you put them on the spot. If you push them hard enough, they come out with co-factors. Then the next round would be name me a co-factor. Then you’d say, why does the co-factor heroin or AZT need HIV? It can do it just as well without it. Then the one co-factor is gone. You stay with the drugs.

When I began my training in economics, the question of relevance meant one thing: how will that education play a role in your total training, the job you will get, the life you’ll want to lead, and the income you will earn. That has fundamentally changed, especially in the past 40 years. You read books on education today and the word relevance is no longer with regard to its relationship to the lifetime of the person. It is how much money will I be able to make as I get my first job, etcetera? Relevance has become associated fundamentally with the narrow aspect of earning. The question of principle went to the board and the question of each person for himself took over. How does that affect me, with what I’m going to get or not going to get? Therefore, this development was part of the development of the economics profession itself. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think in the last 30 or 40 years, if I use strong language, I’d say the economics profession did not meet its obligations to the country and didn’t meet them professionally either, namely, what began to happen both on the side of so-called new Keynesians and classical economics, is that it became ideological. And the ideology became part of what I mentioned, throughout the country: finance, money markets, the degree of arrogance. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe businessmen thought they knew what was right better than any government regulations. And the view was taken one way or another that business, by their own decisions, with the lack of government regulation to deregulate, would be able to conduct the economy effectively with high employment for the end of time, with complete loss of the view that uncertainty is the crux of any economy. Every morning a businessman wakes up, they should realize that uncertainty prevails and that you need a balance between the operation of a good market system and government regulation. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the arrogance with regard to the individual businessman, the banking system; that hedge-funds, investment funds, could take over and run it well to that degree became the value pattern, not only of the business community but in one way or another, the assumptions were based in economics on the same kind of principles. And in that regard, the economics profession failed. It was for that reason, to a large degree, that the 2008\u002F2009 great recession was the result, that the business community could so do whatever they… therefore, I get calls every day: why don’t you take a second loan on your house with a low rate of interest? The pressures from the business community and the loan market were just absolutely savage. And of course people made a mistake when their incomes weren’t high enough, to obtain such borrowing. So they also erred, but in that regard, I think to a very substantial degree, the economics profession was trapped in the arrogance of the age itself in the last 30 or 40 years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, I think in dealing with the great recession, some of the legislation, especially with regard to consumer protection, reasonably good legislation, has been passed — moderate, I think it hadn’t gone far enough, but there have been some improvements. Regrettably, I find that in a good deal of the business community, the errors of the last 34 years still prevail. They still believe the nonsense that a market could work without intelligent government regulation. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EAnd what kind of regulation do you think has been missing?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s a good question. With respect to the banking system, to be sure that the banks would hold enough reserves, so they would not speculate excessively, would not provide loans excessively and go bankrupt… you had an interesting situation in which economics and the law broke apart. Now I’m talking in the earlier period: after 1937, ‘38 to about, say, the 1960s. You had a situation in which the economics profession at that time developed very well. And we were in a situation known as macroeconomics. Namely, realizing when you have a recession that its most important characteristic is the loss of effective demand. Businesses don’t invest, consumers don’t spend enough, and therefore, there is not enough effective demand to produce goods and services. This is macroeconomics, aggregates. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe law, in money and banking, however, was microeconomics. Namely, the central bank only had the authority to change relative rates of interest, to lower its rate of interest when you were in a recession to get out. But they didn’t have the power to increase aggregate effective demand during a recession. The macro economics in the economics profession again, was not translated into law because the pressure groups in our country, largely the financial institutions, the banks, did everything in their power so that regulation would be reduced, and that became a major reason for the recession of 2008 and 2009. And now, incidentally, the Federal Reserve has been given such power, some power, so that they can now increase aggregate effective demand during a recession. That has been a fundamental aspect. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EDo you see any relationship between what you call this increase in arrogance to the need to really protect consumers from themselves?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. I think that’s perfectly right. I don’t want to underestimate it. The consumers… I want to be honest, completely honest. In my judgment, the people that provided the loans made a greater mistake than the people who had accepted them. Nonetheless, there’s no question that many people acted in an irresponsible manner of accepting, borrowing mortgages, etcetera, that they had no business doing because the probability that they would be able to make payment, should somebody lose their job or become ill was not considered enough. But it was part of that mania that expansion would last forever, the expansion would go on. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the new law that was passed, very comprehensive, there is very strong language with respect to the consumer also not being irresponsible. It’s very good legislation, in my judgment, very very long too. I’d say, really, I don’t think that it’s any less important than control on the business side, the hedge funds and all that. You can have irresponsibility on both sides. And to some degree, substantially in the legislation, with regard to protecting the consumer, that has been dealt with. The Congress here has been responsive…a good law. And of course legislation is also pursuing that the banks should hold higher reserves with regards to their own investments, etcetera. That’s indispensable. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ENow, would you mind speaking about the importance of multilateralism?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot of inconsistency on that subject today. Just last week, the Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, yesterday, was in China, and was discussing the fact that China, in her judgment, has been behaving irresponsibly in claiming that in the South China Sea, that its relationship with Vietnam or the Philippines, should be bilateral. That when there are conflicts of interest, questions of legality of control over raw materials, oil, resources, that they should deal with it under law, the two countries, the United States should stay away, and it should not be under multilateral law, but it just should be those two countries. Hilary Clinton, correctly in my judgment, argued that that is a very unfortunate situation. That the interest of many countries there is a multilateral interest and includes the fact that the United States maintains a power position as a trader in Asia, in the Pacific area, and our interests would not be taken care of if such conflicts were dealt with bilaterally rather than multilaterally. That makes perfectly good sense to me. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a professor of international economics, I can state without question that in the his tory of commercial policy, multilateralism has served the world much better than bilateralism ever can, because if countries sign bilateral agreements, the element of power, the larger country, more powerful country vis a vis the small one, comes into play and the smaller country then has to make adjustments with other third and fourth countries because they made the bilateral arrangement. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, multilateral means that under what is known as the MFN Clause, the Most Favored Nation Clause, established in 1860. It states that if the United States and Canada make an agreement, if the United States and Canada reduce their tariffs, then the reduction in tariffs that, say, Canada makes becomes a reduction for all other countries that have those kinds of treaties with Canada. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERealistically, that sounds sort of crazy. Why, if we make an agreement with somebody else for a reduced tariff, why do we have to give the same reduction to somebody else if they don’t? Because in practical terms, that’s the best way to handle it. Because if you don’t, three weeks later, that country, say Canada, could give another reduction to somebody else and there went the advantage you had. Multilateralism is that if Canada afterwards makes another agreement with Sweden and gives them an even lower rate. Now, now. We get it right away. Otherwise, the tariff reduction we had with them goes to the boards. So realistically, multilateralism is the best way for free countries to operate. But while Mrs. Clinton was telling China that it should follow multilateralism, unfortunately, the United States has not been doing so either. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the last 15 years, the United States has signed 15 bilateral trade agreements. Most recently, we’ve negotiated another bilateral agreement with South Korea, and the Congress has not yet ratified it. That’s most unfortunate. (Congress ratified the agreement on October 12, 2011.) It may be said that perhaps, and there’s some truth to this, the atmosphere has changed. It was very difficult to get a multilateral agreement. There’s truth to that, but regardless of that truth itself, the United States has been indulging in bilateral trade agreements. In other words, the United States has not been consistent with regards to its own foreign trade policies, and its inconsistency has reduced the strength and the power of the World Trade Organization that tries to conduct trade multilaterally the world over. That is regrettable and the United States should change that view to as much as possible. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut to be realistic, I have to make this reservation. For over ten years, countries have been negotiating for a more open multilateral system known as the Doha Development Round, the Doha. The final meeting will be on May 15th at 17:00. I happen to be very well-informed on it for many reasons, and it’s gonna fail. The countries have not been able to negotiate an agreement. The reasons are many and complex but to a large degree they are due to the fact that the developed countries: Japan, Europe, the United States discriminate in favor of their agriculture, with very high subsidies to their agriculture, and therefore, the developing countries that are coming up, India, Brazil, have taken position in the negotiations, that if the United States, Europe and Japan would stop these discriminatory policies for agriculture, which only means that American consumers are paying higher prices for agricultural goods then otherwise would be, \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003E\n they have given evidence that the developing countries would gain more from a freer trade pattern than all the aid that has been given to them in history. And it’s true.\n\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the emerging countries are now more interested in developing their own banking systems, their own insurance systems, etcetera. Therefore, they’re not too eager to open up the economy, with respect to what’s known as intellectual property rights particularly. And for these reasons and many others, some are very highly technical, the negotiations are going to fail. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIt sounds like it may be both impractical and possibly unethical? Is it a mixture of those considerations? Do you think it promotes \u003Cspan class=\"not-italic\"\u003Eboth\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E fairness and general thriving?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt creates more fairness, it creates a situation where the whole world will be getting goods at the lowest prices they could and sell their goods at the best prices they could to the rest of the world. And it will have the tendency of reducing the role of government in trade and have more trade conducted by business firms. That’s much better. If trade is conducted among business companies, the element of power does not play so great a role. And therefore, trade that’s conducted by corporations is much better than trade that’s conducted by governments. And bilateralism leads more toward government manipulation and power. Yes. It’s more fair, more efficient, more economic, and serves the world’s interests best, especially the developing countries, and that could be to our interests too. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the situation we are in now, to be practical and realistic, we may…there are certain circumstances where a bilateral agreement makes sense. I would say especially with respect to the Arab Spring.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003E\n If the United States opened its markets, freer trade, to the countries that are trying to move out of their dictatorships to more democratic countries, that is probably the most important single thing we could do to the success of those revolutionary moments\n\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat their industry, their infrastructure could start developing, jobs could be created to export to the United States. In those cases, there may be justification to have some bilateral agreements of this kind in particular, but these should be the exception rather than the rule. In other words, in the world in which we live, the principle should be multilateral trade but there are cases where exceptions may be warranted. But I think that should be operating through the World Trade Organization to see if some rules and regulations can be made, as to under what conditions bilateralism may be more acceptable. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EYou had this incredible opportunity to go to Sub-Saharan Africa and analyze their economic practices, some time ago.

They won’t do much good. Common markets between countries that produce practically similar products don’t go very far, and China is playing more and more role in Africa, with regard to development, but they are moving primarily into minerals, raw materials to export back to China. But, I find in many cases, it’s going to help, but China is playing a very important role in moving into those countries. Much of it much better than people think but also bad things.

Human capital and physical. Namely, in the next 30 years, the greatest competition that we will be facing will be in the fields of those infrastructures where innovation of new products and services will play the major role. Therefore, in the United States, brilliance and training of the human agent and the transformation of it into the physical assets as well, so the efficiency of capital should keep increasing in regards to new products and services. That’s my view.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EHuman beings. Nobel prizes, that’s capital.

I think that one of the greatest unfortunate things that happened during the great recession of 2008\u002F2009, is the budget deficits that the states got into. Education is financed primarily by the states not the federal government. And in all the states, the budget deficits have been such that investments in education have been terribly reduced, for all the universities in virtually all the states. I think that one of the best things that the federal government can do, not only now but for the future, is to see that assistance is provided to the states to be able to maintain their investment in education and training. That, I think, is one of the most important. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI also think that, in time, a bi-partisan commission should be formed to analyze the possibility of establishing an American infrastructure bank. We had the Tennessee Valley Authority, a company formed by the government, with complete independence. The government had nothing whatever to do with its running, its regulation, its management. They did a remarkable good job in the south with respect to energy. We need an American infrastructure bank. Namely, a bank that would make investments in forms of research, with regard to technology, with regard to health, with regard to such fields as bridges, roads, transportation. The United States ought to have a fast transportation system in, say, the whole area of the eastern United States should be better than that of Japan’s, or Germany’s, Holland’s. We’re like an underdeveloped country in that regard, and I think for a private company, it doesn’t pay to get into it because the profits don’t come fast enough. But a government, an American infrastructure bank, that makes more sense because it develops the whole region, taxes are increased and then it pays for itself, with particular emphasis on maintaining and increasing the efficiency of human, again, and physical capital investment. That, I think is where the government could play the major role, without the government having anything to do with running it or regulating it. That should be done by the best personnel we can get to manage it and run it. I think that’s essential. \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWould you say that one of the difficulties to enacting these measures that may be controversial is that elected officials are worried about getting reelected and tend to play it safe?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. I think there is no question whatsoever that policy formation in every field is being influenced, close to a definitive degree by the need for senators and congressmen to gather enough capital to be re elected. And realistically, they have to depend on it, and consequently, fear. The emphasis on financing one’s campaigns for both Democrats and Republicans has become paramount, and that’s playing, I’d say, a key element in the lack of decision-making process. At present, their ideologies are so divided that it’s practically impossible for them to reach compromises without the fear that they won’t get the primaries and get re elected. That’s a very serious problem in our country. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many, many people, some good friends of mine, that have virtually given up on the future of the United States for that reason. I do not. I happen to believe that the diversification of this country is very great, and its history, a great one, that it will take time to get out of the present terrible divisive situation that exists. It is my belief that given the very unfortunate economic conditions that now exist, the unemployment rate probably will be high for the next two or three years. That under those conditions, it may very well be that enough of the American public will, I hope, once again, show the kind of reason that has been shown in the past, in electing people that are more reasonable as compared to those in the extreme ideological situation, where you have lunatic orthodoxy often dictating policy. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to increase the debt ceiling is really a state of lunatic orthodoxy, or to establish a constitutional amendment that the country, the federal government should balance the budget every year. Because, as under President Hoover’s thinking, if you get into a recession, at that time, the government has less income and a budget deficit begins to develop. That’s called an automatic stabilizer, because government expenditures, unemployment expenditures are maintained but revenues drop, so effective demand slowly begins to rise. But if you say balance the budget, under those conditions, then that means reduce government expenditures. If you reduce government expenditures, you get more unemployment, revenue is reduced to the treasury and the budget deficit gets larger. If it gets larger, you say, well, you have to balance the budget. Cut expenditures again. The notion of balancing the budget every year, therefore, is lunatic orthodoxy. A country such as ours should balance the budget but through a cycle, through a whole, say 7, 8 years. Not every year. For the longer term, I think \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nthe US will regain its tempo and expansion and political improvement will keep increasing.

But when the income distribution greatly deteriorates as it has in our country recently, people feel that equality among individuals is not being adhered to, that the tax system and the economy is working just very much for the rich, and minority groups, black students, younger ones, don’t have equal opportunities, and then murder in Oakland occurs more and more. The value pattern of the country, of Me-ism, lack of responsibility politically, of compromising, of reaching agreement, of honesty in discussions, and the movement of ideology takes extremes. You get Madoffs. After all, the greatest corruption the world has ever seen. Over 50 billion dollars.

I think that there’s been a great deal of exaggeration of the notion of the non-nation-state. There has been a lot of discussion that communications are so increased that the nation-state will become less important. Now, let me be careful. I think, first, the great recession of 2008\u002F2009 has played an important role, not only in increasing the pace of the United State’s reduction of its influence in the world, because before the great recession of 2008\u002F2009, the collapse of communism convinced many people that the Washington experience, as it’s called, in other words, American private capitalism is the future for the whole world. Fukuyama wrote a book on it, the End of History, and that that was practically ensured, that private capitalism would be the future and the nation-state would become less and less important. I think that was an error in the sense that, though it is true that in Europe you had the common market, nevertheless, the last 30 years, whenever a technical issue came up and it was provided for the people to vote on it, the people were wrong. I very much dislike saying this, because up to about 10 years ago I believed the opposite. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI believed that you could nearly always rely upon the good judgment of the electorate. I think that is true when the issues are not technical. In the last 30 years, as I mentioned, in Europe and the United States, whenever a technical issue was given to the electorate to decide upon, they were wrong on the decision. So in Europe, you had the European common market but when they had to vote to establish a unification politically of Europe, they voted against it. It didn’t go through. And I found that to be true on virtually every technical issue in our country as well. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, because of the great recession, central tendencies, say of Belgium, for the European community, greatly reduced in importance, and every nation began to act more according to its own national will, national wishes and needs. So since 2008\u002F2009, confidence in an unregulated capitalist system that was the image of a great deal of the world has virtually disappeared the world over, and nationalism is increased. That every country is behaving more nationalistically rather than less as compared to previously. Therefore, I believe that insofar as the nation-state is concerned and its future, the notion of no nation-state barriers, that’s nonsense. It will not happen. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EDo you think that scholars are consulted by the government to the extent that they once were? Has that changed?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s changed tremendously. Say 50 years ago and more, there was a group of people in the country, non-political, and they were members, as far as one knew of both the Republican and Democratic parties that provided a set of judgments and opinions that were practically published every day in the newspapers and listened to by the entire country. They, in fact, formed a non-political, realistic, responsible class of citizens that expressed their judgments on key issues of national affairs, and were listened to by the congress, by the press, etcetera. That’s virtually disappeared. It practically doesn’t exist today. At the moment, we have a Council of Economic Advisors and the National Economic Council which is practically not even heard of. You’d ask most people and they wouldn’t even know who the chairmen were. This has greatly deteriorated, in this case, particularly recently. It’s very important that universities should provide the leadership for that kind of judgment, when the need today is so great. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EYou mention, in your book \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mqup.ca\u002Fcrises-and-compassion-products-9780773538207.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ECrises and Compassion\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, you [write] about your father’s disposition and his way of dealing with conflict, and I found that set the stage for you to talk about your history of relationships.

My father was a dictator. The truth is, I did not love my father. I respected him because he was a brilliant person. But the background from Russia was such that there was never any civility of discussion with him. It was always dictatorial, ‘You do this. The position on this is this.’ And nonetheless, a surprising thing happened. When I was four years of age, as I discuss in the book, he had a wonderful young Russian woman come to teach me how to read and write Russian, arithmetic, etc. Now this was a surprising phenomenon because my father was very very tight with money and he’d have to pay her. Therefore, I had to conclude, he came to the conclusion (because this was always crucial for him) that the yield will pay off, that an investment in me by a good teacher, would be worthwhile. No sentiment. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd as I state in the book, as a kid, I wanted to play. So whenever she came, I didn’t want to appear like a sissy so I would say, “Huh.

I would come in and she would read Pushkin to me, the great Russian author for children.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EThe truth is that I fell in love with her.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo on the one hand, you had this tremendous impact, again, when you don’t have civility of discussion between parents and children, the impact that it could have upon a character. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd secondly, the other part, the teacher that I mentioned, she played such a fundamental role in my life, from the age of 5 on. I believe that her impact in that regard was another force that instilled in me a love of books, a love of reading, and getting along with people in a convivial way, that she, as the adverse to that situation with respect to my father, played a fundamental role for the rest of my life. A good deal if not the most important education occurs between the relationship of parents and their children, even before they go to school. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, when you are in a recession, as we are in today, even though we are out of it, you have the view that it may not be wise to spend the time and the money to go to college. Many students who speak to me now say that. I think they are making the biggest mistake. Because the heart of going on for graduate work in greater education is not necessarily the fact that you’ll be able to make more money. Of course they will. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEven now, students who have a BA degree and are over 25, have an unemployment rate of only 4%, whereas the unemployment rate in the country as a whole is 9.2. Dropouts have unemployment at 25%. So that the aspect of education and higher income is true, but that is not the fundamental aspect of it. The fundamental aspect of higher education, more education, that the students often want to pursue, even when conditions are as bad as they are, is that it gives them more alternatives in their life, than anything else. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWell, that brings me to the question of what you’re working on these days.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have one more book in my mind, in my head. I’m 92 years old, as you know. And there are two fields that I’ve worked in all my life. One was international economic policy and theory and the other was the history of economic analysis. And two presses have asked me to put together articles that I’ve published in the history of economic thought into a book, and I’m considering doing that. It would be called the \u003Cem\u003ENew History of Economic Thought\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, by which I mean, covering the period from mercantilism, 1550 to the present, and to examine in each case, what did the economists of the period state were the key issues in their countries and how well they addressed them. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I began the first chapter on this, which I am finishing called \u003Cem\u003EMass Unemployment Under Mercantilism, 1550 – 1750, as a Condition of Early Capitalism\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, and here’s what I found: 3 great economists of the 20th century — Professor Heckscher from Sweden, Professor Viner from Chicago, and Professor Schumpeter from Harvard, virtually disregarded the problem of mass unemployment under mercantilism. And I ask myself how these economists could have disregarded that important issue. One, the technical knowledge did not exist to explain mass unemployment, either contemporary or historical. Second, they were conservatives interested in long run equilibrium analysis, so they underestimated the importance of unemployment. I find it incredible that such a situation should occur and the economics profession didn’t recognize it. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I should say that when John Maynard Keynes published his \u003Cem\u003EGeneral Theory\u003C\u002Fem\u003E in 1936, it dealt primarily with mass unemployment. Thereafter, Heckscher and Viner, reappraised their analysis of mass unemployment in the mercantilist period. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EThis illustrates how, with new technical knowledge, we reappraise every period in history.

So, I come from Greece. As an undergraduate, I studied electrical engineering. That was probably some of the unhappiest time of my life, my college years. It was the Greece of the colonels, the dictatorship. My subject did not interest me, and the parts that interested me were given to me in the most mundane way possible. I was motivated to learn interesting things but I was spinning my wheels, so you know, it was all frustration. Then it became worse, I went to the army for a year. I decided to get out of there. I applied to graduate schools in the United States basically to get out of Greece. Doing graduate studies was not in my culture or in my plans. I was not a great student. I was not motivated. I was more interested in politics at the time. And then I came to Princeton, very open minded. Pursuing my studies was one of the options, but it definitely wasn’t the dominant one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I came to Princeton. It was one of the two or three places that admitted me of all those that I had applied to. I don’t know why they did. They admitted me to the program that would be now called Computer Science. And that had me enchanted from day one. For all these years, I had been looking for something like this, perhaps exactly this. And I had not suspected that it existed, I sort of wished and prayed it existed. On top of this, I seemed to be very good at it. So, immediately it was sort of paradise. You know, sometimes you look at, or listen to, or read a piece of art and your mind is in denial of the existence of something so beautiful. So in the same way, I could not believe that I was so lucky, that this was happening to me. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was a very interesting time for my field. Computer science is a very very young field. It’s like 60 or 70 years old, as opposed to mathematics.

The field was at a turning point. Today, you are lucky if you know all of the tiny little corner of computer science you are working on. So, maybe I was the last person who knew all of computer science. After I graduated, I went to teach. I went to Harvard for a couple of years. I came to Berkeley as a post-doc, then I went back to MIT. Then the crazy idea came to me to go back to Greece and teach computer science in Greece. It was a foolish idea, perhaps. Anyway, it didn’t go well. It wasn’t a happy homecoming, and a few years later, I got an offer from Stanford, an offer I couldn’t refuse. I tried to split my time between Greece and Stanford. It didn’t work. And so I left Greece. I went to UCSD for a few years, and finally I came here… it’s almost 2 decades now. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EYour work is quite technical for someone like myself.

Algorithms are the ways in which computers solve problems. Now, the point is that there are things called computational problems. They are the things that are supposed to be solved by a computer, ok? Some of them are easy. If enough people get their heads together and they devise the right method, they will do it, ok? They will finally accomplish the goal. Some others are hard. In fact, some are completely impossible. \u003Cem\u003EThe Birth of Computer Science\u003C\u002Fem\u003E is a paper written by this English mathematician and philosopher, Alan Turing, in 1937, where he considered computational problems, problems that you would have liked a computer to solve. That was 1936, ten years before the first computer, but this guy was thinking about these problems. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo there are problems that you would have liked a computer to solve but they cannot be solved.

To my mind, the most traumatic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore that, science was progressing linearly. At the beginning of the 20th century, David Hilbert was saying that there are no unsolvable problems, all problems will be solved. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you have to talk to someone more clever than you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you need to wait a couple of generations, but they will be solved. It was the 20th century that brought us things that cannot be done, ok? There can be no complete system that proves all mathematical theorems, that was Gödel’s theorem. Or you cannot measure both the position and the velocity of things. Or you cannot run as fast as you want, ok? Or there are simple to state problems that are unsolvable. You cannot solve them mechanically.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EComputer science was born with a dire awareness of its own limitations, whereas physics and mathematics encountered them in their middle age like the rest of us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, computer science had absorbed this trauma. We knew from the beginning there are problems that you cannot solve. Incidentally, the problem that Turing pointed out that is unsolvable, it has to do with software. It is essentially the problem of certifying that software is correct, safe for you. He proved that this is impossible. What software engineers are trying to do are clever compromises, because they know they cannot do it in general. So they are trying to find domains in which it can be done, with luck, very broad domains, but still a compromise of what one would have liked to do. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn any event, we knew that there were impossible things, but \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EComplexity Theory is about the realization that came to us later, 30 years later: that no matter how fast computers become, there are problems that can be solved in principle but take exponential time. Astronomical time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, to solve any decent-sized problem of this sort, it would take humongous amounts of time, in fact, many lifetimes of the universe sometimes, ok? And so complexity theory is an intellectual effort to look at computational problems and try to classify them into those that you can solve in a satisfactory way and those that in principle you can do but you really can’t do because time is limited. Of course technology is galloping, but it’s not galloping fast enough for this. I mean, it will never conquer those problems, ok? Now, these are sort of definite limitations… exponential algorithms are beyond our reach, will forever be beyond our reach. It’s just that, maybe we are going to shave off a little more… as technology progresses, maybe we will be able to solve slightly bigger sized problems but we will never get where we want, where we need to be. Am I being dense and obscure? \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003E“Problems” is sort of an open-ended sort of thing.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, sure, sure. So… the traveling salesman problem. It’s very simple to state. Suppose I give you 50 cities. What you have to do is visit them, that’s what the traveling salesman you are consulting for has to do. And you know the distances, the airline fares or something, between any two cities, and you want to find the shortest, the best way to visit all of them. Of course it can be solved. You can essentially, in principle, check every single one of the rearrangements of the orders in which you could visit the cities. The trouble is that this is way way too much. For 50 cities, this is a number that has, I don’t know, 70 digits or so. So, no matter how fast computers become, even if all molecules of the earth became computers and they operate at the speed of light, it would never happen. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EThat’s hard to understand. It seems like something that could be worked out in a matter of minutes.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EComputers are very fast, but even the fastest computers today, they could not do more than a few billion of those a second, ok? And then there are about 100,000 seconds in the day, ok? And this means there are less than forty million seconds in a year. All right? And we, so far, we only have 10 digits. 60 digits to go. So we need a number of years which is much bigger than the expected lifetime of the universe to do this. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EOn one computer.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn one computer. Excellent. So now imagine that we mastered all the computers of the world, in fact, we build… \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIf all the molecules [on earth were computers]\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s another, I don’t know, 10, 20 digits? \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWow. Huh. Ok. I would never have guessed. I probably watch too many movies.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERight. So, the question is, all right, going through all rearrangements of cities, one by one, is out. But that’s the stupid way. Maybe there is a more clever way. People have been trying to find a more clever way for this and other problems, more clever than rote enumeration of all possible solutions. I mean, they have been able to find clever ways to do it in practice, even though they don’t quite find the best but they find a good one. They find a decent solution. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean, it’s not like traveling salesmen in the world are out of business, you know? But this is actually a problem that occasionally you have to solve, for machine drilling, for many things. It’s important to solve this problem, and yet the algorithm that you will find efficiently, in a reasonable amount of time, the optimum solution has eluded us. We don’t know how to do it. This is one of thousands of problems of this sort, problems that you would have liked to have solved by a computer. There is this software that is supposed to get your data and compute your taxes. Is it correct? Will it always give you the right answer? This problem cannot be solved. That we already knew. But now we are saying that even in domains as benign as geography, you have problems that are impossible because of this kind of exponential growth, astronomical time requirements. So people in the 60s started observing that such problems were coming up. And when in the early 70s, I was starting my work, they had already identified the issue, which was the following: these problems that seem to require exhaustive enumeration, one after the other, over a lot of solutions, are they really… is there a way to solve them, a more clever way than exhaustive search, or not? And still we haven’t been able to answer it 45 years later, but at least we have identified it as a problem. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you heard of the P vs. NP problem? It’s a big thing. It asks you exactly this. P is the class of problems that we know how to solve. NP is the class of problems that we’d like to solve. The question is, are they the same? This is one of the deepest problems in mathematics. I’m not working on it anymore, but a lot of clever people are. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhat are the implications? Once we know that or if we do?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ll tell you what I think. This one will end up having a lot of implications, all right? If it’s proven that it can’t be done, which everybody believes, the implications are that we will have to resign to another imperfection of the world, ok? We’d have another cruel fact of science to deal with. If it can be done, then the implications go much further. But my interest in the matter goes beyond that. I mean, there are a few questions that are so fundamental, of such panhuman interest, that trying to answer them is a duty to our humanity. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EI mean, if we manage to find out how to stay on this planet for another few thousand years, and we don’t answer those questions, what’s the point?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EQuestions like, where did life come from? Are there problems where an exhaustive search is necessary? Is there a single equation that explains all forces in the world? I think it’s on the level of those questions. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EI see that you are getting into questions of evolution. That’s interesting, how it intersects with computer science.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ll tell you. Evolution was my second or third transgression since I came to Berkeley. Since I came here in ’96, I started working on something else that could be called economics, game theory. I am still working on algorithms and complexity, but since I came to Berkeley, I started thinking about other things. 1996 was the time when the internet and the web became real, and they had to be reckoned with. In some sense these artifacts were as important as the first computer. Even more. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EIn my opinion, computer science is no longer about the computer, ok? Computer science — it’s about the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe computer happened to be the gadget that brought us the internet. And now this is our object of study. Now, the internet has sort of completely transformed computer science. It has made it, in some sense, into a natural science. Because, \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003E\n The way a neuroscientist looks at the brain, the way economists look at the market, the way a physicist looks at the universe, or a biologist at the cell, the same way computer scientists now look at the internet: puzzled, bewildered admiration.\n\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s mind boggling, it’s grand, and I need to understand it. And I need to understand it, by the way, the same way that a natural science understands its object: through falsifiable hypotheses, experiments, observations. It’s not like in the old days when you construct something and then you study it, like computer science had been doing. The internet was something that emerged, ok? It emerged through the interaction of a lot of entities. Service providers, companies, users, hardware manufacturers, content providers. So these are the entities. Each one of these entities, they are basically trying to advance their station, advance their own good. In other words, there is no single entity like in the old days when a computer was designed by IBM, actually by these 3 engineers, so we knew what was going on. In this way, computer science has become much more like a social science. Computer scientists are studying social networks now. They are sociologists. In some sense, they are the most relevant kind of sociologists. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EI can see that.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s a complete transformation… the last 15 years have been an incredible evolution for computer science. So my work is trying to understand this. Game theory studies rational behavior in situations of conflict where individual agents, seeking their own interest, create something called an equilibrium. Scott Shenker is a great internet researcher, a colleague of mine here at Berkeley, one of the great thinkers about the internet, and he says that the internet is an equilibrium. Equilibrium basically is what participants in the game are supposed to do. The internet is an equilibrium. We just have to identify the game. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ELike an ecosystem has equilibrium.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPrecisely. An ecosystem where everybody does what’s written on its DNA, adapted in response to what everybody else does. Yeah. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo you are looking at the rules of the game?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETrying to. Actually, what I’m doing is a little more mathematical and less empirical. I’m trying to revisit game theory in view of its role in the new world of computation. Maybe I can tell you the result that I am most proud of. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EPlease.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, this is something that I’ve been working on for 15 years, more than 15 years, since the late 1980s, and we solved it in 2006. Frankly, I never thought that I would see it solved. It has to do with \u003Cem\u003EA Beautiful Mind\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Have you seen that movie? Ok. Nash’s theorem. John F. Nash, 1995 Nobel Prize winner for this theorem. The theorem says the following: every game has an equilibrium. Ok? It’s a beautiful reassuring theorem. He tells you that in every situation of conflict, there is a combination of behaviors that will end up in equilibrium. Quiescent. Extremely rational. In some sense, we can predict what will happen. We know what will happen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EOne of these.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of these equilibria. Basically, this theorem propelled game theory into a science. Its message is one of universality, it reassures us there is an equilibrium in every game. No matter what situation of conflict you concoct, there is always a way for people to be have that will be sort of mutually quiescent. Given what everybody else does, what I’m doing is fine, ok? And so this had a lot of impact. Roger Myerson, a great game theorist who won the Nobel Prize 13 years after Nash, for something completely different, in 1999, he wrote about Nash’s theorem. He basically said that Nash’s theorem lies at the foundation of modern economic thought. Because it gave such prestige to the modern point of view of homo economicus, of economic agents who are deeply rational, seeking the best for themselves. So the Nash equilibrium has been extremely influential, not because Nash proposed it – the concept had been around – but because Nash’s theorem gave it such prestige. And the technique used to prove the theorem immediately inspired two other great economists, Arrow and Debreu, to come up with the famous price equilibrium theorem, which basically says: in any market, you can find prices so that everybody is happy. They will sell what they have. They will buy what they need. It’s one of those magical things that says, ok, the world is a nice place. I guess this work was the beginning of modern economics, of post-war economics. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, trouble is, Nash’s theorem says that in any situation there is an equilibrium but it doesn’t quite tell you how to find it. It tells you: there is at least one, but beats me how to find it, ok? They give you a convincing argument that, assuming it doesn’t exist, it leads to absurd things. But where is it, man? I don’t know, ok? And people, all over the next half century, they have been trying to come up with algorithms, computer programs where you give them a game, a situation of conflict, and they try to find for you the equilibrium. None of these were good in a sense. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EAll of them smacked of exponentiality.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so we were suspecting that this is an intractable problem, intractable in the sense that inherently it cannot be solved in less than exponential time. But the Nash equilibrium was a very special specimen. It was a very special kind of problem. We had to find, to invent new kinds of intractability to deal with it, and I told you, that was almost 20 years of work. But it ended up being 2006 when we proved it with my student Costis Daskalakis — he’s now a professor at MIT, and Paul Goldberg from Liverpool. We proved it. We proved that if the world is as we understand it, the equilibrium promised by Nash’s theorem will be inaccessible in some cases. You need exponential time to reach it, and we know that’s a resource that we don’t have. So, the universality of Nash’s theorem is suspect, false. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo put it dramatically, there is a computational hole at the foundations of modern economic thought. It’s a result that brings the computer science point of view and mindset center stage at another field, at a great other field, one that I admire immensely, economics. And I think this is sort of the other development of the past 20 years. Computer science has sort of invaded, has affected, has changed the game in many other fields, not only through the use of powerful computers, not only through instrumentation, but through offering a different point of view. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EComputer scientists, in order to understand their own problems have developed a specialized point of view, a sort of a new kind of scientific thinking, which can be useful – often crucial – in understanding other fields. Because in almost every object of study, there are some latent computational aspects. There is some hidden computation underfoot, and the computer science point of view sort of grabs that. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EThe need to falsify things if we can?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, not falsify… how should I say it? Proving limitations is definitely one thing we can do. But, more generally, the computer science worldview points out the computational nature of what is going on in other fields, finds a new way of looking at the field, a computational way of looking at its problems. This sometimes reveals new structure, brings up gems. I’ll give you another example. Down the corridor is my colleague, Umesh Vazirani, who works in quantum computing. The quest for quantum computers started in the 1970s with Richard Feynman, the great physicist, the quest to build computers based on quantum mechanics that would outperform exponentially today’s computers, and so, for example, they might someday solve some of these problems like the traveling salesman problem we discussed earlier. Actually, now we know this is not in the cards. But that was the dream. And over the years, people tried hard to formulate mathematically what a quantum computer would be like, and Vazirani was one of the pioneers of this. There are many people around the world now trying to build quantum computers after this blueprint. But almost 15 years, 20 years later, this quest has morphed from a constructive thrust to build powerful computers into a very incisive point of view on quantum mechanics. It has become, if you wish, a computational critique of quantum mechanics. So, you understand what I’m saying? It’s a completely new way of understanding quantum mechanics. It has profoundly changed and informed quantum physics. So this is the kind of thing I’m talking about. You asked me about my work on evolution. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EYeah.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt started 5 years ago. God I’m glad, I’m glad I didn’t miss this phone call. Somebody called me from the Miller Institute. We have a beautiful institution here in Berkeley. It’s called the Miller Institute for research in science. Somebody gave a big chunk of money to the university and endowed it in the most beautiful possible way: bring every year a dozen or so young scientists to Berkeley to stay for three years and do anything they want. So, they hand-pick the best of the best from all over the world and they bring them here. This adds a lot to the campus life and to the lives of these young people who later go on to become famous scientists. At any rate, somebody from the Miller Institute called me and asked me, ‘There is guy, this biologist, but he says that he wants to learn mathematics and computer science because this is what he needs to study evolution, and this is confusing the hell out of everybody in the biology department, and so they don’t want to touch him, ok? So, would you be interested in talking with him?’ I said, ‘Sure.’ \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo when you want to solve these hard problems, like the traveling salesman problem, you can start playing games, like saying sort of, imagine that the solution to the traveling salesman problem is an organism that has an environment, and let’s see how evolution will change it. So, you start with the solution and then you change it a little and see how good the mutation is, and then you change it again and again, and you keep the good mutations only. Random mutations, a few are bound to improve the solution. And these heuristics often work well. They give you decent solutions to the difficult problems, ok? And then somebody said, wait a minute, maybe we can do something better. And they came up with what they call genetic algorithms, which is basically even more faithful to the reality of nature. They started to do sex, recombination. So, you have two solutions, and let’s see what their offspring are going to look like. Take some ideas from that one and some ideas from this one. Maybe it gets the bad ideas of both, in which case it dies, but maybe it gets the good ideas and in which case it’s better than its parents. If it’s good then it will procreate more, and so on and so forth, plus mutations, of course. This is a genre of programs called genetic algorithms. They do evolution by sex, recombination. The amazing thing is that the asexual evolution algorithms do very well, while the sex ual algorithms don’t. You know, they do worse then their asexual counterpart, in practice. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EAs far as…\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProducing good solutions. In the soup, in the population after many generations, you want to find fantastic solutions. Really good solutions. And you don’t. You don’t see that. Even though the primitive mutation-only counterparts do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003ESo how come nature’s favorite trick, recombination, sex, falls on its face when programmed in a computer? How come sex works in evolution and it doesn’t work on a computer?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know, the point is that in order to solve the problem by the genetic algorithm, the program does the following. It says, all right. There is something called the fitness of an individual. The fitness of an individual is basically its potential for producing a lot of offspring, a measure of how able, clever, robust, strong, fertile, an individual is. And they identify this fitness with how good the solution is. So it assumes that evolution’s purpose is to optimize fitness, which seems rather obvious for anyone who has read Darwin. Everybody had been accepting this. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first met this new biologist, this new Miller Fellow whose name was Adi Livnat (he is now a professor at Virginia Tech), we were discussing all this. I told him about my puzzlement about the failure of sex in optimizing fitness when programmed on a computer. Then we looked at each other and we said, what if evolution’s purpose is not to optimize fitness? \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIsn’t it strange to give it a purpose at all?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s not only strange, it’s patently wrong. Strike that. What I’m saying is, what if evolution does not optimize fitness? \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EYeah, just looking around. You wonder, don’t you?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ve now studied evolution enough to know that a lot of strange things go on all the time. It’s slow and subtle and has reversals that are apparent and reversals that are true. But there is the neo Darwinian thought about evolution, the last 80 years. It’s called the modern synthesis, meaning put ting together Mendelism and Darwinism with a little math. Its basic premise is a bunch of mathematical equations about the fitness of populations, and the standard interpretation of the equations is that fitness is what is optimized in the process, ok? Well, it’s not. We proved it in black and white. The scientific establishment has yet to take it to heart. But they will. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ETell me more. Explain.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, that natural selection under sex… it turns out that it’s not the survival of the fittest. It’s something else. Subtly different. Natural selection without sex, it does optimize fitness, nobody is disputing that. The fittest individuals will basically take over, and ultimately all of the population is going to look like them, ok? But natural selection under sex does not promote fitness. It promotes mixability. What is mixability? Our genes come in many variants. They are called alleles. Maybe we have some alleles of two genes which, when combined, they create a very fit individual. The liver is in perfect condition, it will outlast everybody’s liver. In an asexual species, this will be selected. All right? \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut with sex, it turns out that what matters is not so much the allele combination that will perform best, but rather alleles with the property that they perform adequately over a broad range of other alleles. Mixable alleles. They will perform well with a wide variety of genetic partners. And this is what natural selection under sex favors. Some biologists I talk to slap their forehead. It’s something that everybody should have thought in the second year of graduate school but somehow they haven’t. It’s not a new mathematical model, it's a simple mathematical observation about the model everybody had been using the past 80 years. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EI was noticing that you talk in terms of proofs and proving things.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMathematical biologists want to use mathematics in order to explore the truth in biology. The mathematical part of biology is not as developed as, say, the mathematical part of physics, but also other scientists and engineers… the tradition is that they are impatient with biology. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EBiology looks like a bunch of details. The point is, life is lots of details.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have an immense respect now for the practice of biology, the way it’s done. I think mathematical biologists, of which I am vaguely one, they should approach their craft with humility, because the truth is dirty and full of details. And the more clever you become, the more details come out. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EYeah. I was thinking of the difference between like induction and deduction and how the sciences are more inductive, and math is different that way\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut physics, for example, takes in math much more easily, and so does chemistry, economics. You know what I’m saying? These are disciplines that are thirsty for math. Biology… always it’s a little tougher going I feel. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you’ve noticed, I have been to other places before Berkeley. Harvard, MIT, Stanford, a few more. I now know that I am never going to leave this place, ok? There is no other intellectual environment like this. I have a lot of other things to criticize it for. I’m not a chauvinist, praising my home, but I will tell you what attracts me most about it. Before I came to Berkeley, I was a good computer scientist. I was doing very mainstream computer science work. And I’m grateful to Berkeley because coming here and living in this very open and alive place, a place that is exactly how a university should be. Well, I believe that this environment… not exactly inspired me, but it gave me the impetus, the chutzpah, the courage to… it made me realize it’s possible to do the crazy things I’ve been doing since then. Like economics, biology, and so on. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EFreedom.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFreedom. Precisely. A very, very aggressive form of academic freedom. I mean, Stanford is fine, and so is Princeton and Harvard and MIT. So, you know, I’m not putting down those great places… but I really find Berkeley is different. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIs it less administrative work here do you think? That’s not it?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo no no. If anything it’s worse. Much worse. At a rich school you get all the help you can hire. My colleagues are always complaining that they have to do a lot of things. The point is… your real creative work, if you are lucky, it’s half an hour a day, or an hour. You know what I’m saying. If you can find this hour, and everything else is conducive to it being really productive, really sort of high quality, who knows what can happen during that hour? I mean, when I was at Stanford, that was another very productive period of my life, and I was essentially a single parent of a baby, so I had really no time. But I liked my situation. I loved my baby, and she inspired me, so taking care of her made me want to do great things. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo what’s next for you? Looking ahead, what kind of projects do you see coming up here? Or what are you doing now?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI want to continue everything I’m doing. But I am looking for something else. I don’t  know what it’s going to be. I’m very interested in neuroscience. I see it as another field that can be scrutinized, productively looked at from the computer science point of view. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIt’s important work.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I don’t know if you want to talk about the other crazy thing that I do, which is write novels. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EYeah. I know about that.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt never would have occurred to me in another place, but when I came here, I guess, a few years later, I started writing fiction. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhat is it about Turing?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn some sense, I’ve been working on Turing’s legacy. My work had always been on Tur ing’s intellectual legacy. That’s what theoretical computer science is. He started it. But frankly, I knew practically nothing about him. Then I read the book by Andrew Hodges. There’s a wonderful, very powerful biography, \u003Cem\u003ETuring, the Enigma\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, and then I really got into Turing. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you want to hear the story? I was reading this book, \u003Cem\u003ENeuromancer\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, a novel very much like a film noir, it certainly recalls Dashiell Hammond, some kind of hapless op trying to sort of figure out something. It’s a climactic point in the book, the end of part 3. He comes back to his hotel room and he finds it full of cops. And they tell him, “Turing, you are under arrest.” And that’s a very strange sentence. I mean, for me it was a very powerful sentence. It turns out, in this book’s world there is the Turing police. It’s a force that’s making sure that there is no artificial intelligence, because it’s a dangerous thing. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EDo you think it is dangerous?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo. This is an echo from an old tired debate. No. Frankly, you know what I think? \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EThose who live in fear that one day we’ll be ruled by machines are probably not paying enough attention to those who are ruling us now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can’t get much worse; I guarantee you. So don’t be afraid of machines, really. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIf I learn one thing today…\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I took from that book this sentence, “Turing, you are under arrest.” It stayed with me for years. What if it’s all lies and Turing is alive? He’d be in his seventies or eighties. What if you bump into him? What if he turned up unbidden somewhere? So this is essentially the plot of my book. Essentially, Tur ing is a program that likes to teach math and computer science. My book is a love story between two people, and then there is a character that is Turing. It’s a modern love story set in the year 2007, back then it was the future. So it’s a love story and one of the other characters is Turing, the program. It wants to turn people around and stuff. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhat did this do for you?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, it completely changed my life. I will tell you what happened. I had never written a poem. I had never written a short story. It had never occurred to me that I would ever write anything. I mean, I wrote textbooks and I wrote papers. Then, it was probably 97, 98, I forget. I was in Greece and I went to see… do you know this poet Cavafy? One of the great poets in the 20th century. He’s not well known. A Greek poet, born in Alexandria, Egypt. So I went to see a movie, a Greek movie titled \u003Cem\u003ECavafy\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. I liked it so-so, but coming out of the movie, I remember I was really interested in the gesture of the director, to create a piece of art and to give it the name of your intellectual hero. I had never thought about it, but that night, the plot came to me. I started to write it. I wrote it for two and a half years. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean, it completely changed my life. It so happened that I’ve never been analyzed. I’ve never done psycho analysis, ok? I have nothing against it, but it just didn’t happened to me. I’ve talked to many people who’ve had it, and writing this book, it sounded like, you know, it seemed to me, like it was indistinguishable in terms of the effects it had from a few dozen of extremely successful sessions. A lot of crying, a lot of sort of finding inside of me things that I never would have suspected before. Really, I think I would be half a man, I would be half what I am, if I had not done this… worse than half.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EI would be missing a dimension. You know what I’m saying? Missing a dimension is worse than half. Compare the square with the segment or the cube.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIt’s hard to know what you mean when you say that. It’s just the impossibility of knowing really what you’re talking about.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. Definitely. You are saying that you sense that my experience was so profound that’s it’s hard for somebody else to understand? \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIt’s so individual. It’s fascinating that something like writing a novel can do that.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt completely changed my mind. So I just finished my third novel. There have been some profound experiences, but nothing like \u003Cem\u003ETuring\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, the first one. Right now, I think I would have written my first novel in a completely different way. I love it. I’m proud of it, and so on, but it has flaws. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhat kind of privacy issues are we dealing with on the internet? Should we be concerned about that?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EListen, ok. Privacy will always be a problem, like freedom, decent pay, health care, you know what I’m saying. It’s always going to be a problem. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIs open access the bigger problem then?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s always going to be a problem. And it’s always going to be a struggle between people that want privacy and forces that want to take privacy away. I think that the ideological battle has been won, and the issue is on the table, at least everybody pays lip service to that. I think that ultimately, the healthiest way to deal with privacy is… I don’t want to be economistic, but it’s economic. You say, you want my data? Sure. It’s yours. I charge that much. I think that’s the healthiest thing to do, but it requires volumes of legislation and much new technology. In other words, it cannot be done in a vacuum. It needs a society that is mature enough to recognize that this is the way to go, and a benevolent state that would provide the tools, provide the legal framework. I think it would require an incredible change. I will tell you what I think in general. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI am a reasonably sunny person, an optimist, ok? But the state of the world is not good. I look around and I see black, and I think that the only huge great positive force in the world today is the internet. And of course there are issues. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EDo we need a police force for the internet?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, no! (wild laughter) The cliché is that the internet wants to be free, which means free of government intervention, free of oppression, and I guess free of charge. No no no no. We don’t… listen… \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWe don’t need people to keep people honest?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the internet will make and keep people honest, ok? Here is how I think of it. Basically, I think the internet is the greatest threat to the power of governments. Ok? Look at WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks for me is the promise of the internet. It’s sort of the generous injection of humility to those who believed that they were omnipotent. Ok? They are not. Their time has come. The internet has been eroding, constantly, the power of the state. And the state is fighting back. There is so much legislation…in conjunction with terrorism, in conjunction with the completely evil issue of intellectual property rights, and copyrights, and the way it’s being handled by governments, the issue of patents and so on, all these sort of forceful malicious interven tions of governments. Of course the oppressive governments in places like China, Iran, Saudi Arabia are fighting the internet, but so do the governments and parliaments of alleged democracies like the European Union and the United States. Iran and China are just thugs who hack away. But the dangerous assaults come from the parliaments. But I think the internet has the resilience needed to survive this and more. When the people of Egypt arose, the first thing Mubarak did, was shut off the internet. I bet you that all governments would love to do that. But the point is that it is also the aorta of the economy. The economy would collapse without it. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EThere’s no going back.

My mother and father were extremely interested in my education. With some dispute over which Ivy League school it was that I should go to. I went to Yale, which is where my father got his masters, following his undergraduate degree from West Point, which was 1924. I had picked Yale because I thought there was value to a general broad education, even though I knew I was interested in Chemical Engineering. And then, for graduate work, the idea was I should go to some place that focused very especially on what I was interested in, and \u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EAll the textbooks had been written by people who were at MIT, so I went to MIT\u003C\u002Fp\u003E and got a doctorate from there in 1960, with the last year of that being simultaneous with my first job, which was to direct a school of Chemical Engineering Practice School station at what was the Bayway Refinery in New Jersey. That was a novel form of education that MIT had. Instead of a masters degree for masters students they had students go out to these industrial locations with an MIT faculty member, which I was for two years, on hand to find good problem areas for them to work on, interface with the company, and so forth. And then, after that, I knew that I wanted a faculty position and I chose between two places. One was a brand new program in chemical engineering at the state University of NY, at Buffalo, where they kept recruiting me by saying they tried to model themselves on the University of California at Berkeley. The other opportunity was the University of California at Berkeley. Why not go to the place they want to model on rather than to their own place? That's how I got here in 1963, 48 years ago. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhen did you first get involved with the Center for Studies in Higher Education?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe center here? That was after my entire career which had been all the Chemical Engineering stuff, research, which I kept going quite late into the game. I was doing research, supervision, and university administration at the same time for a number of years. So, after I had done all that, and after I had done various administrative positions, ending up being provost for the system… you can only take that kind of schedule for so many years, and I had done it for nine and a half, and there was to be a turnover in the presidency from Dick Atkinson to Bob Dynes, so did I really want to undertake more years with a new president, and I came to the decision before I even talked with Dynes that I’d really like to move on to another phase of my career and not have every moment spoken for.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that then raised the question of what to do next. The essential choice was going back into chemical engineering, where I had only been out of the research world for 5 years, and pick it up again and go forward, or make use of all these university administrative posts and the experience I had gained in them. And the latter made sense. The Berkeley campus came to me and they’d been having a search for some years, with ups and downs to it, for somebody to lead this center. I decided, that's the way to make use of all of this accumulated experience in various higher ed. administrative posts, and would actually be intriguing and interesting to me. Although I took retirement at the point of leaving the provost position, I am on what is called a recall appointment here. I think the ingredients in me are somebody who is a scholar by nature and at heart, plus a wealth of accumulated experience. Put that together to try to do research related to the accumulated experience. And to make it more interesting, the crisis of funding public education has arrived and is boiling away right now, so that certainly gives us issues to work on. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWould you mind talking more about that? Is it directly related to the economy or are there other factors going on, with this decline in public funding?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EIt's a complex situation but I don't think the funding of public education by governments is going to spring back to where it once was. I think we’ve had permanent changes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the ingredients of this, put in a nutshell…. the United States is rather unusual among countries by having its public universities be creatures of the individual states rather than of the country. Here in the U.S., the University of California reports to the California state government, the University of Texas reports to the Texas state government, etcetera. And so, factor #1 is that our universities in the public arena belong to the states. Factor #2 is state budgets have gotten extremely pressed, and they are pressed for many reasons. One is the difficulty of raising income, because of the unpopularity of new taxes, or higher taxes. Another is the ever-mounting costs relating to health care, which are burdens of the state. Another in California is locking up the state budget. So, we pass propositions in California, and they tend to say that the state must do this even without generating the money to do this, whatever it is, or they are a restriction on something, like Proposition 98, years ago, which said that a certain fraction of the state budget must go to the school system, or they are limitations on income such as old Proposition 13, from decades ago, which placed a cap on what can be derived from property taxes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo there is in California, something like a little less than 20% of the state budget that is actually manipulable by the state government. The rest is just locked in statute as to what it shall do. So, the three big things that are in that slightly less than 20% are all of public higher education, which means UC, CSU, and all of the community colleges, the state money for the community colleges, prisons and various welfare programs. So those three are left to compete against one other with only a small portion of the budget to work with. The result of that has been that the state contribution to higher education as a percentage of the state budget has gone down and down as other things arise that present needs, and state money as a percentage of the total budget of a university like the University of California has gone way down. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, the result of that is that public higher education is left either looking for sources of income, new sources of income, larger sources of income that aren’t state money, or cutting back its program, and there are states that have gone the route of the public university charging high tuition for out of state and foreign students and just reducing the percentage of in-state residents that go to the university. But in California, that will not work because the California public values a UC education, hugely, therefore they want to maximize the number of Californians who can get into it. And to reduce services to the state, such as by getting a whole lot of high fee paying students from other countries and other states, is just not a popular thing here — nor does it make a lot of sense for public education if it's supposed to educate the public of California. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo these are the essential issues and the university is searching and turning in many directions on that — relations with industry and all of the concerns we can have about keeping companies from exerting undue influence on the university. Over the last 30 years the public universities have turned big towards private fund raising, so the Berkeley campus itself came a few years ago out of a 2 billion dollar capital campaign, billion with a b. And I can think back to around 1980, and at that point, the university didn't really have a development office even. Development offices are what support the fundraising effort, so it's been a relatively recent phenomenon. And it's very consumptive on the time of the chancellors. They will spend half or more of their time out there raising money. There is the long answer to a short question on what is the crisis of public education. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EHow do these ballot initiatives work in? Are these anomalies or are they happening more frequently that you see?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI moved here in 1963, and what was happening in the ballot initiative world then was very very different. What happens now is that it takes a certain number of signatures to put an initiative on the ballot or the legislature has to decide and vote to put it on the ballot, but most of them come by gathering the signatures. So what happens is that you go to the supermarket or you go to REI or wherever you might shop, and you will find somebody sitting at a table out front. And as you go in they say something like, ‘Do you like the environment?,’ something to which the answer is surely ‘Yes,’ and then they try to get your signature. And they are in fact, those people are paid signature collectors. So getting an issue, an initiative on the ballot is a matter of spending the money that is required to pay the signature collectors to collect the requisite number of signatures. That’s a trend of the last few decades, that one effectively buys one’s way onto the ballot by that mechanism.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there is the issue of how these initiatives are phrased as the campaign goes on. My experience, over the last few decades has been that from the advertising, you can't really recognize what the initiative is about. The advertising may or may not, and probably does not completely focus on the substance of the initiative itself, and in a sense, that is another way of spending money to get something passed. So there are a lot of interest groups, and they have reasons to get things passed, and so they do. That is sort of the jaundiced view of the state initiative system. There are a number of public forums right now, like the New America Foundation and even part of the activities of the Commonwealth Club that are trying to straighten out this situation and make it work better, rather than being as much as it is a world of spending money and getting a result on the ballot by having spent that money. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWould you mind talking about the intersection [of] universities and corporations and where you think that’s headed?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that has been an area of substantial change and it’s something that I’ve had a lot of involvement with over the years. In fact, I was one of the 7 or 8 founders of something called the Council for Chemical Research, which was put into operation back in the very early 1980s, and was an organization of both chemical companies and universities with an aim to trying to find ways to enable and foster appropriate relations and interactions between companies in that industry and universities. I even had some research of my own that was sponsored by a corporation. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I think two things, I think many things but two of them are that, it is important to enable interactions and exchange of thoughts between corporations and companies, otherwise the university, which is trying to do research of a comprehensive sort in the full worldwide and public arena, is missing some important input that it might have, so it was useful to me, in designing my own research in chemical engineering to have direct knowledge of what corporate needs, desires, interests, what were big problems in industry, things that might be addressed through research of a sort that was fundamental for doing in a university. I differentiate that from the sort of thing that would be done by a corporate research department within a company, where they’re going to look at the world of research accomplishments out there, take a few things, and run further with them because they believe they are very close to the interests of the company. This would be a matter of doing what one does in academic research, which is trying to build a related body of knowledge, a coordinated, related body of knowledge that builds and feeds upon itself. In effect, you are building the garden from which the companies would pick particular things in order to pursue them further. And if I’ve got to build that garden, I’ve got to know something about what those companies are interested in. So I would first of all say that it’s very important to have the interactions and the contacts. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second thing is that since the corporate world is for profit, and money is a huge factor, you then have to be very careful that you have appropriate guidelines, constraints, and policies, to keep some kind of conflict of interest situation or inappropriate diversion of university effort to a company from occurring. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a number of posts that I was in, we would concern ourselves at various times with policies for creating that envelope within which the faculty could work. So, policies on conflict of interest: if you are going to apply for research support from a company, where you also have some kind of financial interest, such as, you consult or you own some substantial percentage of the stock, then that proposed arrangement has to be looked at by a confidential and totally independent set of faculty from various quarters around the university to make sure it’s ok, that it’s within standards. So that would be conflict of interest. Conflict of commitment is another thing we care about, which is essentially what are you worried about when you wake up in the morning and get ready to come to work. Are you worrying about your university work or are you worrying about some company in which you are involved? So we have rules saying you cannot be an officer of a company. We have rules saying you may have leave for one or at most two years at the most to do something in the corporate world before you make a decision about which it is you’re going to do in the future. So, you can’t just have a continued leave to work in the corporate world. We have rules with regard to publishing results of research; it has to be published. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe do have technology transfer offices that recognize that the results of some of the research in a university does have commercial value. Therefore, it’s worthwhile for the university to get patents on that research. There is something called the Bayh-Dole Act. The Bayh-Dole Act of about 1980 did say that ownership of intellectual property from research that was done through government grants to the universities, lies with the university. So, therefore, the university has a way to create ownership of inventions. It has been variable as a revenue source for universities. In most universities, it’s not much of a revenue source. Some have had some big winners that have made it a significant revenue source in some places. Then the university technology transfer office is concerned with licensing of that technology to corporations that would like to have it. And so the corporation can then pay a revenue, a royalty, for the use of that invention. The university gets the royalty as income, and several things are done with that money. One of the first things that’s done is to pay the expenses of the office that does the technology transfer. So, it’s a source of income for that. It is also money that goes flexibly into the overall university budget. And then the system here at UC and the campuses each have policies with regard to the distribution of licensing revenues and how much they would send back to the colleges and schools and departments of the faculty members whose invention it was that got licensed. And then a certain amount goes to the faculty member, to give them incentive to participate in the patenting process. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EI have to say though, backing off on all of this, my first statement is important, which is that research becomes sterile if you don’t have knowledge of what the needs are there in the corporate world. The university does need that knowledge. It’s intellectually beneficial to all to have interactions in professional society meetings or wherever.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut on the other hand, there are legitimate reasons for being concerned that there might be improper corporate influence on a university, and therefore, we have a large number of rules, and regulations, and policies on this. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIt’s amazing that it works.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s a very complicated world, that is correct. And keeps a lot of people busy. It also has been vital to the employment and economic growth of the United States. A vivid example sits right here in the San Francisco Bay area.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EWe had Silicon Valley sprout where it is. That had everything to do with the existence of Stanford but also the UC campuses in the area, access to and interactions with these faculty members, and then more recently, the biotech industry arrived here and that had everything to do with the universities here and the desires of the companies to draw on them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next wave is what is called nanotechnology which is very small-scale designs and devices on the level of collections of atoms, and that industry gives every prospect of growing in this area too because the Bay Area has been able to foster a climate of technological innovation, and has, not only the universities that companies would want to be near but all the rest of the infrastructure required for starting new companies. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EThere’s so much more money required for the sciences. Do you think that there’s an imbalance because of that?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell that’s a very big concern within universities. And it’s not a yes or no question. Because the answers will be different for different places and will have nuances. But, there’s no question, the growth of government supported science since WWII has given incentives to universities to grow in science and technological areas. The fact that they can cover their indirect costs for this, and even in some cases, build buildings and facilities with the money that comes in, for doing research. That’s an incentive. There’s no question about it. Now, universities have responded differently to that, and this one right here, the University of California and the Berkeley campus, is a university that has historically had huge strength across the entire gamut of disciplines: humanities, social sciences, science, engineering, professional schools, it’s all been here. We do have concerns about keeping the strength of the fields that aren’t so eligible for government grants: humanities, fields like anthropology, and sociology that don’t have as much access as another social science, economics, or the world of natural science and engineering do to government money. So we do work to make sure that we keep our strength across the board. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat however, is going to be put to the test once again with the shrinking of the California public support for higher ed. So, the University of California is in a situation where it’s going to have to continually assess its mission, possibly have some changes in its mission, and determine how all of that intersects with the business model, because we’ve got to have a business model that works. By business model, I mean do what we do that brings in money, be it tuition, be it state support, be it corporate research support, whatever. And it works. You have the ability to derive funds in order to pay for what is going to be your output, your product.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the university’s business model is being tested right now because of the reduction of state support. I, for one, hope that we can remain the comprehensive university. I have a number of reasons for that. First of all, I am one who promotes heavily a broad undergraduate education, even for an engineer. I am part of a group, nationally, that is trying to convert the accredited professional engineering degree in engineering from the bachelor’s level to the masters or other graduate level. We’re not close yet, but we are working on it. I think a broad education is important for people for many reasons. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut there is a second reason. That is that the world of universities has grown up with disciplines. Here are the disciplines and they all do things their own way, and your intellectual life is within your discipline, and different disciplines have different ways of doing things. The way an economist works is totally different from the way a sociologist would work, even though they’re both social scientists. So, the world, more and more, has exceedingly complex problems to deal with. I will take global warming as an example. There is a clear technical component to it, scientific and technical, understanding the science of global warming, understanding enough to ferret out what is man-made and what is some variable cycle and what may not be important. There’s a huge amount of fuss on that. I just read an editorial in the Wall Street Journal a day or two ago, where they had picked out some 5 or 6 scientists, whose name people in the field would know, and said they were, in one way or another, skeptics on global warming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003ESo, in that science always has disagreements within itself, we have the phenomenon of others trying to take that disagreement and extend it, and say, well, global warming is not a problem \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, for example.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, there’s a huge social aspect, a political aspect to this, and surely an economic aspect to global warming, that has to interface with the science, as we decide what to do about it as a country and as a world, all of those social concerns have to interface with the technical knowledge and concerns, and that’s something that doesn’t work well within universities. It’s very hard to get a group of scientists to work with a group of social scientists or a group of humanists. There are some examples where it’s worked well, but as a rule, it’s a difficult thing to do. So this is my other reason, now, for feeling that universities need to cover the waterfront with regard to disciplines. You have to have the pieces there when you try to find the way to integrate the thinking among disciplines in order to apply it to something like global warming, or water supply, you name it, arable lands. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EAnd that’s sort of what institutes do, right? They get these people together?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, we have, I think, something like 85 organized research units on the Berkeley campus, the prime mission of which is to bring people from different disciplines together. So that is one of our mechanisms. And then it relates to the industrial thing too. Let me back up a little bit from that. In the year 2000 when Gray Davis was governor of this state, he actually made substantial appropriations available. He worked with the legislature to do this, to create four, very large so-called Governor’s Institutes on Science and Innovation, within the UC system. One of the two at Berkeley is CITRIS, the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society. And the other is called QB3, Quantitative Bio-technology, which is quantitative bio-technology, bio-medicine, and areas like that. So, the governor started us off. And then, what I’m headed to is that a few years later, a major corporation, a major international corporation, BP, known for the gulf oil spill and all that subsequently, decided that it wanted to create a joint industry-university bio-energy research center, and they went around soliciting proposals, identified six groups as finalists, and eventually the group headed by the Berkeley campus won 500 million dollars, over 10 years. That’s a lot of money, and there is a building going up in downtown Berkeley right now at the corner of Oxford and Hearst, that will house that institute. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, let’s look at several ingredients of our conversation here. One is that we’ve ended up with a very singular involvement of a corporation on a university here with this Energy Biosciences Institute, as it’s called. The other is that a visionary governor of the state of California enabled that by his initiative to have these governor’s institutes on sciences and innovation beforehand. They were to be on areas that were promising for the future economy of California. QB3 made the argument that biologically-derived energy is important for the economy of California and that companies would locate here. Here comes BP and makes a partnership for a research center, controlled by all the policies in that area. Now where is the bio industry likely to develop? Right here in the Bay Area. Because of those things having happened. So, I think that’s in part an argument for the desirability of university\u002Findustry relations. It’s an argument for the importance of state investment in the university in order to enable things to come of the research that will improve the economy. It’s a good story. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EI read it mentioned that it’s still a hypothesis that there’s this direct connection between the proliferation of higher education and a booming economy.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, we think that argument is pretty clear, but you have to be careful in another direction on that one too. Because if your sole or principal justification for the university is that it’s going to make the economy boom, that is going to weaken the position of many aspects of the humanities, many things that do not, in the normal public eye, have a tie to the economy, so, at the very least, I think when that argument is made, it has to be a broader argument that says that the university’s research output is good for the economy \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C\u002Fem\u003E society. And there are many things we do that are for the benefit of society, as opposed to the economy. Medicine would be the most obvious one, but surely the arts, literature, etcetera, would fall in that category too. They are certainly beneficial to people, and enrich lives and make for fuller, more complete lives, and so they are part of what a university’s output is too. Then of course of principal product is none of those things, it’s educated people who are smart and will do good things in their careers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI am very convinced of the importance of the public mission for a university like this. We are in a debate that doesn’t always get framed this way but has these elements, nationally. That debate is whether education of people is good for the individual people because it increases their earning power or is it good for society, and both arguments can be made. Historically, the argument for public universities, going back to the Morrill Act of the 1860s, is that by educating the public, you better the life for all because more people are able to do more things and have the knowledge to do it, and will also lead richer and fuller lives. If you read much of what was said back at the founding of UC, words much like that are there. So that was the original aim of public education. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EIt is also true that public higher education in this country has historically been \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C\u002Fem\u003E avenue of upward mobility for people. So, if you are from a very low income family or a family that has no tradition of even finishing high school, and has had relatively menial jobs and thereby low in come, you still, if you have what it takes, are able to partake of public higher education, get that education and rise and do great things. There are many examples of that, a huge number of examples of that in public universities from over the years. And that’s what I think is in danger right now, is that ability to be the path of upward mobility, and I think it’s critical.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe private universities are not large enough to do this. Something like 75% of the university student population in the U.S. is in public universities. Privates and for-profit universities are about 20-25%. So these public universities that we have have to be able to survive and be healthy in carrying out their public missions. And that I believe is what gets lost in the discussion. You just don’t read that that much in the newspapers. So… that’s the crux issue I think. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo, is it more in danger than ever?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUh huh. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIs it because the disparity between the rich and the poor is increasing?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it’s in part one of the reasons why the disparity is increasing, is that public education is losing its ability to carry its full burden. But every state, one way or another, has the problem that California has. California has parts of the problem that are unique to California, like the ease of getting ballot initiatives on, but every state has got this difficulty. And therefore there are many states where the budget for higher education is being cut way back. If you happen to read about Nevada, percent-wise, that cut is far greater than for California, so they really are hanging on for life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EThe difficulty is that in the present structure of things, in the present political climate, nobody really sees a way out of the woods on this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, if things are just left to go as they are going, they will go all the more this way, of cutting back the public budgets for higher education, which means the quality and accomplishments of the public universities will either go down or those universities are going to have to go elsewhere for financial income to enable them operating as they have been. Every source, every different source of income comes with its own set of obligations, if you want to put a negative cast on it all. The fact that the chancellor or president of a private university has to spend 50% or more of their time out there raising money, means that’s 50% or more of their time that they are not using to do good things within the university. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has greatly changed the natures and roles of the presidents’ and provosts’ positions over the years, by the way, because the presidency is very external looking. The provost gets the function of running it to make it work well internally. So, that’s a cost associated with private fund-raising. I’ve talked about all of these controls, and policies, and regulations we have, with regard to interactions with industry, but there’s no question that the more you get tied up with industry, and the bigger the grants or financial arrangements that occur with industry, the more potential there is for diversion of the university from the university mission, or something artificial coming into play. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can guard against much of it, but for sure, if we keep going more and more in that direction, things will happen which, one place or another, which will be causes of great concern. So every way of funding a university other than state fund or endowment becomes an issue of some kind. I should take the most obvious one of all, student fees. You are living here, right? So you read the San Francisco Chronicle maybe. And you then read about the Regents’ meeting last week. So this was on the question of whether to have multi-year plan of fee increases traded back and forth with increases in the state government. That is a hot, hot potato and it didn’t move with the Regents. That’s how hot the potato is. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIt seems like there is a parallel problem with treating students as customers, as there is with working with corporations.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is. The public universities, if you look at the figures, we tend to have as much as twice the student to faculty ratio as a leading private university. And so, just because of that difference, obviously, a student is likely to have less contact with the faculty in a public than in a private, just by those numbers. We do a lot of things to try to enable that contact, and help it happen nonetheless, but that is something to worry about. And if we are headed into a world where the public universities have to increase their private dimension or private side, there will be higher fees and way more intensive fundraising from alumni, so as to try to build endowments. The public has to worry much more about the student as a customer, which has been called total quality management by some, the experience that the customer gets. That’s very true. And it happens, as would not be surprising, there is some sentiment on this campus to try to simply become a private university. That’s got all kind of complications in it, and to my mind would not be a good thing at all, but there are the two things that would make it very difficult just to become a private university. One is you’ve got to get up the intensity of contact with students, nurturing of students, for example, get your graduation rates up at all public universities to over 90%, as opposed to the 65 or 70 that it is for most public universities—we are a bit higher than that. But for very high fees, people should certainly be able to graduate and have a degree at the end of it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the other thing that would be very difficult for turning a leading public into a private would be the endowments. There’s a huge difference between the publics and the privates there, between the leading privates and the publics. So if you look at the endowment per student enrollment, for Harvard, or Yale, or Caltech, or Stanford, it is at least one order of magnitude, a factor of ten at least, greater than the endowment per student of the publics, even the University of Texas, which has a large amount of oil money in its endowment. So you can’t just simply change a public university into a private one, because nobody is going to be able to go out there and raise 26 billion dollars, or whatever is needed worth of endowment, in a short period of time. In a sense, the way that the world of universities works, this is a great oversimplification but it gives the idea, the state money that historically has come into the public universities equates to yield on endowment that the private universities have been able to work off of. Then their other sources of income are about the same. It’s a very crude way of looking at it. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhy is that? Is it old money and loyalties?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd wise investment. There are a huge number of great investment success stories, which of course takes years, but several of the leading privates have done that well. And a rule of thumb is that over large periods of time, even a conservatively invested endowment should grow 6-7% a year, maybe even 8%, and then, what is usually done is that the yield from the endowment annually, the yield taken from the endowment is of the order of 5%, and the remaining earnings of the investment just build the principal of the endowment. That’s how the principals get bigger, over the years. So there’s a big difference that way. The main thing is it’s really going to be a change if the public universities gets thrown heavily into the world of endowments, annual fundraising, private giving, corporate giving, that the privates have been in much longer. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EJust might be forced into it, just by necessity?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr we find other ways to do it. But yes, I have to say that it’s an issue, course, that receives an enormous amount of debate within the higher ed. community right now. And I really have not seen good answers appear. Failing good answers over time, then the quality of the public institutions will go down. And there will be a quality gap, faculty salary gap, everything else between the leading privates and the publics, and it would be a different world. The University of California, incidentally, historically, has been placed, knowingly, by the populace of California, in a position of trying to be about half-way between a public and a private. You’d look at plots, and yes, the privates would have somewhat higher salaries than the publics, and we’d be about half-way in between. Recently the privates have been going up, the publics have been tapering off, and now we are not half-way in between. So that’s a worry for the University of California. It will change the character and the university. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe UC has done a lot for the state in terms of building it both socially and economically, and the economic examples go back to the agriculture industry. A very good example is the fact that around 1880, the legislature enacted a resolution that established a school of viticulture and enology, at Davis, that’s wine-making, and they were to do research to create a good position and knowledge base for the California wine industry. And that’s been an enormous success! And it is really one of the first very visible ways in which the university contributed economically to the state. Agriculture, as a whole, actually precedes the winemaking, because the winemaking went on hold during prohibition, and so the real taking off of the California wine industry occurred after WWII. It’s very much based on University research. It’s another example. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese are things that will not happen if we can’t retain our level of the university. It’s the issue of the day. Which goes right back to the public university question. What can we be in the new world of funding, as it exists. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EGood luck with that.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERight.

We started with some vague curiosity about the alternative farming movement and were quickly reminded that we know very little about mainstream farming practices. The quest to understand the bigger picture resulted in this collection of interviews.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n  Our coverage is an overrepresentation of subjects who are part of the “farm movement” in the Midwest — what many of us still know of as a quaint, feel-good, foodie, niche market — and an underrepresentation of subjects who are part of the system of larger, industrial farms, the means by which most of us subsist these days.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n  It is not our intention to frame the discussion as an either\u002For side-taking opportunity. You, dear reader, are encouraged to resist the urge and simply enjoy the fascinating and alarming foreignness of our food system — foreign like a chicken paw, like algal blooms, like sitting in a combine on Christmas Eve, like $.09\u002Flb. pork, like buying lettuce from the Department of Defense.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E \n  These interviews are journeys through dark, sad places and green pastures, rain storms, droughts, sunbursts and orgasmics. You will clearly understand, and then wonder at, and then understand again, why anyone would ever want to be a farmer.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n  Thank you for reading.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n  Abby McLean\n  \u003Chr \u002F\u003E\n  Specimen is a periodic magazine featuring candid, in-depth interviews with professors and other expert types for everyday people.
