When I began my training in economics, the question of relevance meant one thing: how will that education play a role in your total training, the job you will get, the life you’ll want to lead, and the income you will earn. That has fundamentally changed, especially in the past 40 years. You read books on education today and the word relevance is no longer with regard to its relationship to the lifetime of the person. It is how much money will I be able to make as I get my first job, etcetera? Relevance has become associated fundamentally with the narrow aspect of earning. The question of principle went to the board and the question of each person for himself took over. How does that affect me, with what I’m going to get or not going to get? Therefore, this development was part of the development of the economics profession itself. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think in the last 30 or 40 years, if I use strong language, I’d say the economics profession did not meet its obligations to the country and didn’t meet them professionally either, namely, what began to happen both on the side of so-called new Keynesians and classical economics, is that it became ideological. And the ideology became part of what I mentioned, throughout the country: finance, money markets, the degree of arrogance. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe businessmen thought they knew what was right better than any government regulations. And the view was taken one way or another that business, by their own decisions, with the lack of government regulation to deregulate, would be able to conduct the economy effectively with high employment for the end of time, with complete loss of the view that uncertainty is the crux of any economy. Every morning a businessman wakes up, they should realize that uncertainty prevails and that you need a balance between the operation of a good market system and government regulation. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the arrogance with regard to the individual businessman, the banking system; that hedge-funds, investment funds, could take over and run it well to that degree became the value pattern, not only of the business community but in one way or another, the assumptions were based in economics on the same kind of principles. And in that regard, the economics profession failed. It was for that reason, to a large degree, that the 2008\u002F2009 great recession was the result, that the business community could so do whatever they… therefore, I get calls every day: why don’t you take a second loan on your house with a low rate of interest? The pressures from the business community and the loan market were just absolutely savage. And of course people made a mistake when their incomes weren’t high enough, to obtain such borrowing. So they also erred, but in that regard, I think to a very substantial degree, the economics profession was trapped in the arrogance of the age itself in the last 30 or 40 years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, I think in dealing with the great recession, some of the legislation, especially with regard to consumer protection, reasonably good legislation, has been passed — moderate, I think it hadn’t gone far enough, but there have been some improvements. Regrettably, I find that in a good deal of the business community, the errors of the last 34 years still prevail. They still believe the nonsense that a market could work without intelligent government regulation. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EAnd what kind of regulation do you think has been missing?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s a good question. With respect to the banking system, to be sure that the banks would hold enough reserves, so they would not speculate excessively, would not provide loans excessively and go bankrupt… you had an interesting situation in which economics and the law broke apart. Now I’m talking in the earlier period: after 1937, ‘38 to about, say, the 1960s. You had a situation in which the economics profession at that time developed very well. And we were in a situation known as macroeconomics. Namely, realizing when you have a recession that its most important characteristic is the loss of effective demand. Businesses don’t invest, consumers don’t spend enough, and therefore, there is not enough effective demand to produce goods and services. This is macroeconomics, aggregates. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe law, in money and banking, however, was microeconomics. Namely, the central bank only had the authority to change relative rates of interest, to lower its rate of interest when you were in a recession to get out. But they didn’t have the power to increase aggregate effective demand during a recession. The macro economics in the economics profession again, was not translated into law because the pressure groups in our country, largely the financial institutions, the banks, did everything in their power so that regulation would be reduced, and that became a major reason for the recession of 2008 and 2009. And now, incidentally, the Federal Reserve has been given such power, some power, so that they can now increase aggregate effective demand during a recession. That has been a fundamental aspect. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EDo you see any relationship between what you call this increase in arrogance to the need to really protect consumers from themselves?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. I think that’s perfectly right. I don’t want to underestimate it. The consumers… I want to be honest, completely honest. In my judgment, the people that provided the loans made a greater mistake than the people who had accepted them. Nonetheless, there’s no question that many people acted in an irresponsible manner of accepting, borrowing mortgages, etcetera, that they had no business doing because the probability that they would be able to make payment, should somebody lose their job or become ill was not considered enough. But it was part of that mania that expansion would last forever, the expansion would go on. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the new law that was passed, very comprehensive, there is very strong language with respect to the consumer also not being irresponsible. It’s very good legislation, in my judgment, very very long too. I’d say, really, I don’t think that it’s any less important than control on the business side, the hedge funds and all that. You can have irresponsibility on both sides. And to some degree, substantially in the legislation, with regard to protecting the consumer, that has been dealt with. The Congress here has been responsive…a good law. And of course legislation is also pursuing that the banks should hold higher reserves with regards to their own investments, etcetera. That’s indispensable. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ENow, would you mind speaking about the importance of multilateralism?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot of inconsistency on that subject today. Just last week, the Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, yesterday, was in China, and was discussing the fact that China, in her judgment, has been behaving irresponsibly in claiming that in the South China Sea, that its relationship with Vietnam or the Philippines, should be bilateral. That when there are conflicts of interest, questions of legality of control over raw materials, oil, resources, that they should deal with it under law, the two countries, the United States should stay away, and it should not be under multilateral law, but it just should be those two countries. Hilary Clinton, correctly in my judgment, argued that that is a very unfortunate situation. That the interest of many countries there is a multilateral interest and includes the fact that the United States maintains a power position as a trader in Asia, in the Pacific area, and our interests would not be taken care of if such conflicts were dealt with bilaterally rather than multilaterally. That makes perfectly good sense to me. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a professor of international economics, I can state without question that in the his tory of commercial policy, multilateralism has served the world much better than bilateralism ever can, because if countries sign bilateral agreements, the element of power, the larger country, more powerful country vis a vis the small one, comes into play and the smaller country then has to make adjustments with other third and fourth countries because they made the bilateral arrangement. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, multilateral means that under what is known as the MFN Clause, the Most Favored Nation Clause, established in 1860. It states that if the United States and Canada make an agreement, if the United States and Canada reduce their tariffs, then the reduction in tariffs that, say, Canada makes becomes a reduction for all other countries that have those kinds of treaties with Canada. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERealistically, that sounds sort of crazy. Why, if we make an agreement with somebody else for a reduced tariff, why do we have to give the same reduction to somebody else if they don’t? Because in practical terms, that’s the best way to handle it. Because if you don’t, three weeks later, that country, say Canada, could give another reduction to somebody else and there went the advantage you had. Multilateralism is that if Canada afterwards makes another agreement with Sweden and gives them an even lower rate. Now, now. We get it right away. Otherwise, the tariff reduction we had with them goes to the boards. So realistically, multilateralism is the best way for free countries to operate. But while Mrs. Clinton was telling China that it should follow multilateralism, unfortunately, the United States has not been doing so either. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the last 15 years, the United States has signed 15 bilateral trade agreements. Most recently, we’ve negotiated another bilateral agreement with South Korea, and the Congress has not yet ratified it. That’s most unfortunate. (Congress ratified the agreement on October 12, 2011.) It may be said that perhaps, and there’s some truth to this, the atmosphere has changed. It was very difficult to get a multilateral agreement. There’s truth to that, but regardless of that truth itself, the United States has been indulging in bilateral trade agreements. In other words, the United States has not been consistent with regards to its own foreign trade policies, and its inconsistency has reduced the strength and the power of the World Trade Organization that tries to conduct trade multilaterally the world over. That is regrettable and the United States should change that view to as much as possible. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut to be realistic, I have to make this reservation. For over ten years, countries have been negotiating for a more open multilateral system known as the Doha Development Round, the Doha. The final meeting will be on May 15th at 17:00. I happen to be very well-informed on it for many reasons, and it’s gonna fail. The countries have not been able to negotiate an agreement. The reasons are many and complex but to a large degree they are due to the fact that the developed countries: Japan, Europe, the United States discriminate in favor of their agriculture, with very high subsidies to their agriculture, and therefore, the developing countries that are coming up, India, Brazil, have taken position in the negotiations, that if the United States, Europe and Japan would stop these discriminatory policies for agriculture, which only means that American consumers are paying higher prices for agricultural goods then otherwise would be, \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003E\n they have given evidence that the developing countries would gain more from a freer trade pattern than all the aid that has been given to them in history. And it’s true.\n\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the emerging countries are now more interested in developing their own banking systems, their own insurance systems, etcetera. Therefore, they’re not too eager to open up the economy, with respect to what’s known as intellectual property rights particularly. And for these reasons and many others, some are very highly technical, the negotiations are going to fail. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIt sounds like it may be both impractical and possibly unethical? Is it a mixture of those considerations? Do you think it promotes \u003Cspan class=\"not-italic\"\u003Eboth\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E fairness and general thriving?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt creates more fairness, it creates a situation where the whole world will be getting goods at the lowest prices they could and sell their goods at the best prices they could to the rest of the world. And it will have the tendency of reducing the role of government in trade and have more trade conducted by business firms. That’s much better. If trade is conducted among business companies, the element of power does not play so great a role. And therefore, trade that’s conducted by corporations is much better than trade that’s conducted by governments. And bilateralism leads more toward government manipulation and power. Yes. It’s more fair, more efficient, more economic, and serves the world’s interests best, especially the developing countries, and that could be to our interests too. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the situation we are in now, to be practical and realistic, we may…there are certain circumstances where a bilateral agreement makes sense. I would say especially with respect to the Arab Spring.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003E\n If the United States opened its markets, freer trade, to the countries that are trying to move out of their dictatorships to more democratic countries, that is probably the most important single thing we could do to the success of those revolutionary moments\n\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat their industry, their infrastructure could start developing, jobs could be created to export to the United States. In those cases, there may be justification to have some bilateral agreements of this kind in particular, but these should be the exception rather than the rule. In other words, in the world in which we live, the principle should be multilateral trade but there are cases where exceptions may be warranted. But I think that should be operating through the World Trade Organization to see if some rules and regulations can be made, as to under what conditions bilateralism may be more acceptable. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EYou had this incredible opportunity to go to Sub-Saharan Africa and analyze their economic practices, some time ago. And you saw a need for institutions where training would be provided to develop experts.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ve written an article called \u003Cem\u003ETransforming Sub-Saharan Africa\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. I’d like you to take a look at that because that was written really for non-economists. The president of the World Bank, Mr. Zoellick, he wrote me a letter, and in the letter, he said please get in touch with our people at World Bank to follow up your suggestions for policy formation in the United States and other countries. And I did get in touch with the Vice President of the World Bank, etc. \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nIn the article I stress what others do not. One: The Sub-Saharan African countries, of course under colonialism they imported all their manufactured goods and they exported raw materials, etcetera. Therefore, in Sub Saharan Africa, you didn’t get the development of men and women to work in manufacturing. Therefore, entrepreneurship was not developed. I was in these countries in the 1960s and worked with them ever since. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, from most, maybe all, of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, entrepreneurial capacity is the scarcest resource. Without it, frankly, I think that Sub-Saharan Africa will fail again for the next 50 years. Without entrepreneurships in a capitalistic economy, it just doesn’t develop, and that must be done, but people are afraid to say it. It’s not a popular thing to say in Africa. But it’s indispensable. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EInstitutions are needed to get there?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you need to get is Western institutions that could directly work with the people in business and agriculture themselves, some in government, health. Mr. and Mrs. Gates have done a superb job, also in Africa, in using experts that work directly with African farmers and businessmen to help them establish industries. They’ve done very very well. Also, I recommend something.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EWe have a Peace Corps. I think the United States should establish a Poverty Corps.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECollege students just getting their BA, etcetera, or their Masters, are extremely interested in doing what they can in Africa and elsewhere to work there. A Poverty Corps of those kinds of students and retired people could play an extremely important role in Africa, and I mentioned it to Mr. Zoel lick and he agrees. He recommended it to his board but they refused. It was too radical for the time. It’s a paragraph or two in the article, the establishment of a Poverty Corps. I’d like to see that done. I wrote to Obama. I’d like Obama to do it, but he’s got such terrible problems to deal with. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Africa, they are developing common markets everywhere in Africa. They won’t do much good. Common markets between countries that produce practically similar products don’t go very far, and China is playing more and more role in Africa, with regard to development, but they are moving primarily into minerals, raw materials to export back to China. But, I find in many cases, it’s going to help, but China is playing a very important role in moving into those countries. Much of it much better than people think but also bad things. They don’t give a damn how corrupt the government is, or things like that, so you have negative elements too. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003ESo, you said that the scarcest resource in Sub-Saharan Africa was entrepreneurship but what might it be here?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the United States, I think the most important resource for the next 10 or 15 years is the efficiency of capital, the efficiency of capital in the best sense of the term. Human capital and physical. Namely, in the next 30 years, the greatest competition that we will be facing will be in the fields of those infrastructures where innovation of new products and services will play the major role. Therefore, in the United States, brilliance and training of the human agent and the transformation of it into the physical assets as well, so the efficiency of capital should keep increasing in regards to new products and services. That’s my view.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EHuman beings. Nobel prizes, that’s capital. Investment in people.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is the greatest shortage we are having today in technical, engineering, physics, chemistry, biotechnology. etcetera. Our universities have to make the greatest investment in human and physical capital. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWhat do you think the government can do to promote that?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. I think that one of the greatest unfortunate things that happened during the great recession of 2008\u002F2009, is the budget deficits that the states got into. Education is financed primarily by the states not the federal government. And in all the states, the budget deficits have been such that investments in education have been terribly reduced, for all the universities in virtually all the states. I think that one of the best things that the federal government can do, not only now but for the future, is to see that assistance is provided to the states to be able to maintain their investment in education and training. That, I think, is one of the most important. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI also think that, in time, a bi-partisan commission should be formed to analyze the possibility of establishing an American infrastructure bank. We had the Tennessee Valley Authority, a company formed by the government, with complete independence. The government had nothing whatever to do with its running, its regulation, its management. They did a remarkable good job in the south with respect to energy. We need an American infrastructure bank. Namely, a bank that would make investments in forms of research, with regard to technology, with regard to health, with regard to such fields as bridges, roads, transportation. The United States ought to have a fast transportation system in, say, the whole area of the eastern United States should be better than that of Japan’s, or Germany’s, Holland’s. We’re like an underdeveloped country in that regard, and I think for a private company, it doesn’t pay to get into it because the profits don’t come fast enough. But a government, an American infrastructure bank, that makes more sense because it develops the whole region, taxes are increased and then it pays for itself, with particular emphasis on maintaining and increasing the efficiency of human, again, and physical capital investment. That, I think is where the government could play the major role, without the government having anything to do with running it or regulating it. That should be done by the best personnel we can get to manage it and run it. I think that’s essential. \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWould you say that one of the difficulties to enacting these measures that may be controversial is that elected officials are worried about getting reelected and tend to play it safe?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. I think there is no question whatsoever that policy formation in every field is being influenced, close to a definitive degree by the need for senators and congressmen to gather enough capital to be re elected. And realistically, they have to depend on it, and consequently, fear. The emphasis on financing one’s campaigns for both Democrats and Republicans has become paramount, and that’s playing, I’d say, a key element in the lack of decision-making process. At present, their ideologies are so divided that it’s practically impossible for them to reach compromises without the fear that they won’t get the primaries and get re elected. That’s a very serious problem in our country. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many, many people, some good friends of mine, that have virtually given up on the future of the United States for that reason. I do not. I happen to believe that the diversification of this country is very great, and its history, a great one, that it will take time to get out of the present terrible divisive situation that exists. It is my belief that given the very unfortunate economic conditions that now exist, the unemployment rate probably will be high for the next two or three years. That under those conditions, it may very well be that enough of the American public will, I hope, once again, show the kind of reason that has been shown in the past, in electing people that are more reasonable as compared to those in the extreme ideological situation, where you have lunatic orthodoxy often dictating policy. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to increase the debt ceiling is really a state of lunatic orthodoxy, or to establish a constitutional amendment that the country, the federal government should balance the budget every year. Because, as under President Hoover’s thinking, if you get into a recession, at that time, the government has less income and a budget deficit begins to develop. That’s called an automatic stabilizer, because government expenditures, unemployment expenditures are maintained but revenues drop, so effective demand slowly begins to rise. But if you say balance the budget, under those conditions, then that means reduce government expenditures. If you reduce government expenditures, you get more unemployment, revenue is reduced to the treasury and the budget deficit gets larger. If it gets larger, you say, well, you have to balance the budget. Cut expenditures again. The notion of balancing the budget every year, therefore, is lunatic orthodoxy. A country such as ours should balance the budget but through a cycle, through a whole, say 7, 8 years. Not every year. For the longer term, I think \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nthe US will regain its tempo and expansion and political improvement will keep increasing. I am optimistic, although the process, as you’ve said, will be extremely slow and difficult. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWill you explain a bit about what you mean by value patterns?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy value patterns I mean, a feeling of the people that they are genuine members of society with equal opportunity and a lack of corruption in the judicial system. But when the income distribution greatly deteriorates as it has in our country recently, people feel that equality among individuals is not being adhered to, that the tax system and the economy is working just very much for the rich, and minority groups, black students, younger ones, don’t have equal opportunities, and then murder in Oakland occurs more and more. The value pattern of the country, of Me-ism, lack of responsibility politically, of compromising, of reaching agreement, of honesty in discussions, and the movement of ideology takes extremes. You get Madoffs. After all, the greatest corruption the world has ever seen. Over 50 billion dollars. I think that fair play, at one time, mattered, and I hope still is one of the key ingredients of this country. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the last two or three generations, the element of time has become much less important. The question of how important it is to maintain your value pattern, that if you say you’ll be there at 2:00, you’ll be there at 2:00, virtually doesn’t exist. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EIt may be outlandish to ask about any future decline in nationalism or the possibility of nations more and more united, resembling a single government or fewer governments, but do you see that as a trend in the next 50 years, th\u003C\u002Fem\u003Eincrease in umbrella organizations that coordinate internationally… the work of the United Nations, etcetera? \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo. I don’t. I think that there’s been a great deal of exaggeration of the notion of the non-nation-state. There has been a lot of discussion that communications are so increased that the nation-state will become less important. Now, let me be careful. I think, first, the great recession of 2008\u002F2009 has played an important role, not only in increasing the pace of the United State’s reduction of its influence in the world, because before the great recession of 2008\u002F2009, the collapse of communism convinced many people that the Washington experience, as it’s called, in other words, American private capitalism is the future for the whole world. Fukuyama wrote a book on it, the End of History, and that that was practically ensured, that private capitalism would be the future and the nation-state would become less and less important. I think that was an error in the sense that, though it is true that in Europe you had the common market, nevertheless, the last 30 years, whenever a technical issue came up and it was provided for the people to vote on it, the people were wrong. I very much dislike saying this, because up to about 10 years ago I believed the opposite. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI believed that you could nearly always rely upon the good judgment of the electorate. I think that is true when the issues are not technical. In the last 30 years, as I mentioned, in Europe and the United States, whenever a technical issue was given to the electorate to decide upon, they were wrong on the decision. So in Europe, you had the European common market but when they had to vote to establish a unification politically of Europe, they voted against it. It didn’t go through. And I found that to be true on virtually every technical issue in our country as well. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, because of the great recession, central tendencies, say of Belgium, for the European community, greatly reduced in importance, and every nation began to act more according to its own national will, national wishes and needs. So since 2008\u002F2009, confidence in an unregulated capitalist system that was the image of a great deal of the world has virtually disappeared the world over, and nationalism is increased. That every country is behaving more nationalistically rather than less as compared to previously. Therefore, I believe that insofar as the nation-state is concerned and its future, the notion of no nation-state barriers, that’s nonsense. It will not happen. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EDo you think that scholars are consulted by the government to the extent that they once were? Has that changed?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s changed tremendously. Say 50 years ago and more, there was a group of people in the country, non-political, and they were members, as far as one knew of both the Republican and Democratic parties that provided a set of judgments and opinions that were practically published every day in the newspapers and listened to by the entire country. They, in fact, formed a non-political, realistic, responsible class of citizens that expressed their judgments on key issues of national affairs, and were listened to by the congress, by the press, etcetera. That’s virtually disappeared. It practically doesn’t exist today. At the moment, we have a Council of Economic Advisors and the National Economic Council which is practically not even heard of. You’d ask most people and they wouldn’t even know who the chairmen were. This has greatly deteriorated, in this case, particularly recently. It’s very important that universities should provide the leadership for that kind of judgment, when the need today is so great. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EYou mention, in your book \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mqup.ca\u002Fcrises-and-compassion-products-9780773538207.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ECrises and Compassion\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, you [write] about your father’s disposition and his way of dealing with conflict, and I found that set the stage for you to talk about your history of relationships. So, what do you see as the lessons you take away from your father?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s a very interesting point, and I think that you’re right. My father was a dictator. The truth is, I did not love my father. I respected him because he was a brilliant person. But the background from Russia was such that there was never any civility of discussion with him. It was always dictatorial, ‘You do this. The position on this is this.’ And nonetheless, a surprising thing happened. When I was four years of age, as I discuss in the book, he had a wonderful young Russian woman come to teach me how to read and write Russian, arithmetic, etc. Now this was a surprising phenomenon because my father was very very tight with money and he’d have to pay her. Therefore, I had to conclude, he came to the conclusion (because this was always crucial for him) that the yield will pay off, that an investment in me by a good teacher, would be worthwhile. No sentiment. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd as I state in the book, as a kid, I wanted to play. So whenever she came, I didn’t want to appear like a sissy so I would say, “Huh. That bitch, she’s here again,” to prove I could out swear any Russian. I would come in and she would read Pushkin to me, the great Russian author for children.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EThe truth is that I fell in love with her.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo on the one hand, you had this tremendous impact, again, when you don’t have civility of discussion between parents and children, the impact that it could have upon a character. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd secondly, the other part, the teacher that I mentioned, she played such a fundamental role in my life, from the age of 5 on. I believe that her impact in that regard was another force that instilled in me a love of books, a love of reading, and getting along with people in a convivial way, that she, as the adverse to that situation with respect to my father, played a fundamental role for the rest of my life. A good deal if not the most important education occurs between the relationship of parents and their children, even before they go to school. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, when you are in a recession, as we are in today, even though we are out of it, you have the view that it may not be wise to spend the time and the money to go to college. Many students who speak to me now say that. I think they are making the biggest mistake. Because the heart of going on for graduate work in greater education is not necessarily the fact that you’ll be able to make more money. Of course they will. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEven now, students who have a BA degree and are over 25, have an unemployment rate of only 4%, whereas the unemployment rate in the country as a whole is 9.2. Dropouts have unemployment at 25%. So that the aspect of education and higher income is true, but that is not the fundamental aspect of it. The fundamental aspect of higher education, more education, that the students often want to pursue, even when conditions are as bad as they are, is that it gives them more alternatives in their life, than anything else. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem class=\"interviewer\"\u003EWell, that brings me to the question of what you’re working on these days.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have one more book in my mind, in my head. I’m 92 years old, as you know. And there are two fields that I’ve worked in all my life. One was international economic policy and theory and the other was the history of economic analysis. And two presses have asked me to put together articles that I’ve published in the history of economic thought into a book, and I’m considering doing that. It would be called the \u003Cem\u003ENew History of Economic Thought\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, by which I mean, covering the period from mercantilism, 1550 to the present, and to examine in each case, what did the economists of the period state were the key issues in their countries and how well they addressed them. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I began the first chapter on this, which I am finishing called \u003Cem\u003EMass Unemployment Under Mercantilism, 1550 – 1750, as a Condition of Early Capitalism\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, and here’s what I found: 3 great economists of the 20th century — Professor Heckscher from Sweden, Professor Viner from Chicago, and Professor Schumpeter from Harvard, virtually disregarded the problem of mass unemployment under mercantilism. And I ask myself how these economists could have disregarded that important issue. One, the technical knowledge did not exist to explain mass unemployment, either contemporary or historical. Second, they were conservatives interested in long run equilibrium analysis, so they underestimated the importance of unemployment. I find it incredible that such a situation should occur and the economics profession didn’t recognize it. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I should say that when John Maynard Keynes published his \u003Cem\u003EGeneral Theory\u003C\u002Fem\u003E in 1936, it dealt primarily with mass unemployment. Thereafter, Heckscher and Viner, reappraised their analysis of mass unemployment in the mercantilist period. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"highlight\"\u003EThis illustrates how, with new technical knowledge, we reappraise every period in history.

When I began my training in economics, the question of relevance meant one thing: how will that education play a role in your total training, the job you will get, the life you’ll want to lead, and the income you will earn. That has fundamentally changed, especially in the past 40 years. You read books on education today and the word relevance is no longer with regard to its relationship to the lifetime of the person. It is how much money will I be able to make as I get my first job, etcetera? Relevance has become associated fundamentally with the narrow aspect of earning. The question of principle went to the board and the question of each person for himself took over. How does that affect me, with what I’m going to get or not going to get? Therefore, this development was part of the development of the economics profession itself. </p> <p>I think in the last 30 or 40 years, if I use strong language, I’d say the economics profession did not meet its obligations to the country and didn’t meet them professionally either, namely, what began to happen both on the side of so-called new Keynesians and classical economics, is that it became ideological. And the ideology became part of what I mentioned, throughout the country: finance, money markets, the degree of arrogance. </p> <p>The businessmen thought they knew what was right better than any government regulations. And the view was taken one way or another that business, by their own decisions, with the lack of government regulation to deregulate, would be able to conduct the economy effectively with high employment for the end of time, with complete loss of the view that uncertainty is the crux of any economy. Every morning a businessman wakes up, they should realize that uncertainty prevails and that you need a balance between the operation of a good market system and government regulation. </p> <p>But the arrogance with regard to the individual businessman, the banking system; that hedge-funds, investment funds, could take over and run it well to that degree became the value pattern, not only of the business community but in one way or another, the assumptions were based in economics on the same kind of principles. And in that regard, the economics profession failed. It was for that reason, to a large degree, that the 2008/2009 great recession was the result, that the business community could so do whatever they… therefore, I get calls every day: why don’t you take a second loan on your house with a low rate of interest? The pressures from the business community and the loan market were just absolutely savage. And of course people made a mistake when their incomes weren’t high enough, to obtain such borrowing. So they also erred, but in that regard, I think to a very substantial degree, the economics profession was trapped in the arrogance of the age itself in the last 30 or 40 years.</p> <p>Now, I think in dealing with the great recession, some of the legislation, especially with regard to consumer protection, reasonably good legislation, has been passed — moderate, I think it hadn’t gone far enough, but there have been some improvements. Regrettably, I find that in a good deal of the business community, the errors of the last 34 years still prevail. They still believe the nonsense that a market could work without intelligent government regulation. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>And what kind of regulation do you think has been missing?</em></p> <p>That’s a good question. With respect to the banking system, to be sure that the banks would hold enough reserves, so they would not speculate excessively, would not provide loans excessively and go bankrupt… you had an interesting situation in which economics and the law broke apart. Now I’m talking in the earlier period: after 1937, ‘38 to about, say, the 1960s. You had a situation in which the economics profession at that time developed very well. And we were in a situation known as macroeconomics. Namely, realizing when you have a recession that its most important characteristic is the loss of effective demand. Businesses don’t invest, consumers don’t spend enough, and therefore, there is not enough effective demand to produce goods and services. This is macroeconomics, aggregates. </p> <p>The law, in money and banking, however, was microeconomics. Namely, the central bank only had the authority to change relative rates of interest, to lower its rate of interest when you were in a recession to get out. But they didn’t have the power to increase aggregate effective demand during a recession. The macro economics in the economics profession again, was not translated into law because the pressure groups in our country, largely the financial institutions, the banks, did everything in their power so that regulation would be reduced, and that became a major reason for the recession of 2008 and 2009. And now, incidentally, the Federal Reserve has been given such power, some power, so that they can now increase aggregate effective demand during a recession. That has been a fundamental aspect. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>Do you see any relationship between what you call this increase in arrogance to the need to really protect consumers from themselves?</em></p> <p>Yes. I think that’s perfectly right. I don’t want to underestimate it. The consumers… I want to be honest, completely honest. In my judgment, the people that provided the loans made a greater mistake than the people who had accepted them. Nonetheless, there’s no question that many people acted in an irresponsible manner of accepting, borrowing mortgages, etcetera, that they had no business doing because the probability that they would be able to make payment, should somebody lose their job or become ill was not considered enough. But it was part of that mania that expansion would last forever, the expansion would go on. </p> <p>And in the new law that was passed, very comprehensive, there is very strong language with respect to the consumer also not being irresponsible. It’s very good legislation, in my judgment, very very long too. I’d say, really, I don’t think that it’s any less important than control on the business side, the hedge funds and all that. You can have irresponsibility on both sides. And to some degree, substantially in the legislation, with regard to protecting the consumer, that has been dealt with. The Congress here has been responsive…a good law. And of course legislation is also pursuing that the banks should hold higher reserves with regards to their own investments, etcetera. That’s indispensable. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>Now, would you mind speaking about the importance of multilateralism?</em></p> <p>There is a lot of inconsistency on that subject today. Just last week, the Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, yesterday, was in China, and was discussing the fact that China, in her judgment, has been behaving irresponsibly in claiming that in the South China Sea, that its relationship with Vietnam or the Philippines, should be bilateral. That when there are conflicts of interest, questions of legality of control over raw materials, oil, resources, that they should deal with it under law, the two countries, the United States should stay away, and it should not be under multilateral law, but it just should be those two countries. Hilary Clinton, correctly in my judgment, argued that that is a very unfortunate situation. That the interest of many countries there is a multilateral interest and includes the fact that the United States maintains a power position as a trader in Asia, in the Pacific area, and our interests would not be taken care of if such conflicts were dealt with bilaterally rather than multilaterally. That makes perfectly good sense to me. </p> <p>As a professor of international economics, I can state without question that in the his tory of commercial policy, multilateralism has served the world much better than bilateralism ever can, because if countries sign bilateral agreements, the element of power, the larger country, more powerful country vis a vis the small one, comes into play and the smaller country then has to make adjustments with other third and fourth countries because they made the bilateral arrangement. </p> <p>In other words, multilateral means that under what is known as the MFN Clause, the Most Favored Nation Clause, established in 1860. It states that if the United States and Canada make an agreement, if the United States and Canada reduce their tariffs, then the reduction in tariffs that, say, Canada makes becomes a reduction for all other countries that have those kinds of treaties with Canada. </p> <p>Realistically, that sounds sort of crazy. Why, if we make an agreement with somebody else for a reduced tariff, why do we have to give the same reduction to somebody else if they don’t? Because in practical terms, that’s the best way to handle it. Because if you don’t, three weeks later, that country, say Canada, could give another reduction to somebody else and there went the advantage you had. Multilateralism is that if Canada afterwards makes another agreement with Sweden and gives them an even lower rate. Now, now. We get it right away. Otherwise, the tariff reduction we had with them goes to the boards. So realistically, multilateralism is the best way for free countries to operate. But while Mrs. Clinton was telling China that it should follow multilateralism, unfortunately, the United States has not been doing so either. </p> <p>In the last 15 years, the United States has signed 15 bilateral trade agreements. Most recently, we’ve negotiated another bilateral agreement with South Korea, and the Congress has not yet ratified it. That’s most unfortunate. (Congress ratified the agreement on October 12, 2011.) It may be said that perhaps, and there’s some truth to this, the atmosphere has changed. It was very difficult to get a multilateral agreement. There’s truth to that, but regardless of that truth itself, the United States has been indulging in bilateral trade agreements. In other words, the United States has not been consistent with regards to its own foreign trade policies, and its inconsistency has reduced the strength and the power of the World Trade Organization that tries to conduct trade multilaterally the world over. That is regrettable and the United States should change that view to as much as possible. </p> <p>But to be realistic, I have to make this reservation. For over ten years, countries have been negotiating for a more open multilateral system known as the Doha Development Round, the Doha. The final meeting will be on May 15th at 17:00. I happen to be very well-informed on it for many reasons, and it’s gonna fail. The countries have not been able to negotiate an agreement. The reasons are many and complex but to a large degree they are due to the fact that the developed countries: Japan, Europe, the United States discriminate in favor of their agriculture, with very high subsidies to their agriculture, and therefore, the developing countries that are coming up, India, Brazil, have taken position in the negotiations, that if the United States, Europe and Japan would stop these discriminatory policies for agriculture, which only means that American consumers are paying higher prices for agricultural goods then otherwise would be, </p> <p class=highlight> they have given evidence that the developing countries would gain more from a freer trade pattern than all the aid that has been given to them in history. And it’s true. </p> <p>Also, the emerging countries are now more interested in developing their own banking systems, their own insurance systems, etcetera. Therefore, they’re not too eager to open up the economy, with respect to what’s known as intellectual property rights particularly. And for these reasons and many others, some are very highly technical, the negotiations are going to fail. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>It sounds like it may be both impractical and possibly unethical? Is it a mixture of those considerations? Do you think it promotes <span class=not-italic>both</span> fairness and general thriving?</em></p> <p>It creates more fairness, it creates a situation where the whole world will be getting goods at the lowest prices they could and sell their goods at the best prices they could to the rest of the world. And it will have the tendency of reducing the role of government in trade and have more trade conducted by business firms. That’s much better. If trade is conducted among business companies, the element of power does not play so great a role. And therefore, trade that’s conducted by corporations is much better than trade that’s conducted by governments. And bilateralism leads more toward government manipulation and power. Yes. It’s more fair, more efficient, more economic, and serves the world’s interests best, especially the developing countries, and that could be to our interests too. </p> <p>In the situation we are in now, to be practical and realistic, we may…there are certain circumstances where a bilateral agreement makes sense. I would say especially with respect to the Arab Spring.</p> <p class=highlight> If the United States opened its markets, freer trade, to the countries that are trying to move out of their dictatorships to more democratic countries, that is probably the most important single thing we could do to the success of those revolutionary moments </p> <p>that their industry, their infrastructure could start developing, jobs could be created to export to the United States. In those cases, there may be justification to have some bilateral agreements of this kind in particular, but these should be the exception rather than the rule. In other words, in the world in which we live, the principle should be multilateral trade but there are cases where exceptions may be warranted. But I think that should be operating through the World Trade Organization to see if some rules and regulations can be made, as to under what conditions bilateralism may be more acceptable. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>You had this incredible opportunity to go to Sub-Saharan Africa and analyze their economic practices, some time ago. And you saw a need for institutions where training would be provided to develop experts.</em></p> <p>I’ve written an article called <em>Transforming Sub-Saharan Africa</em>. I’d like you to take a look at that because that was written really for non-economists. The president of the World Bank, Mr. Zoellick, he wrote me a letter, and in the letter, he said please get in touch with our people at World Bank to follow up your suggestions for policy formation in the United States and other countries. And I did get in touch with the Vice President of the World Bank, etc. <br> In the article I stress what others do not. One: The Sub-Saharan African countries, of course under colonialism they imported all their manufactured goods and they exported raw materials, etcetera. Therefore, in Sub Saharan Africa, you didn’t get the development of men and women to work in manufacturing. Therefore, entrepreneurship was not developed. I was in these countries in the 1960s and worked with them ever since. </p> <p>Unfortunately, from most, maybe all, of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, entrepreneurial capacity is the scarcest resource. Without it, frankly, I think that Sub-Saharan Africa will fail again for the next 50 years. Without entrepreneurships in a capitalistic economy, it just doesn’t develop, and that must be done, but people are afraid to say it. It’s not a popular thing to say in Africa. But it’s indispensable. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>Institutions are needed to get there?</em></p> <p>What you need to get is Western institutions that could directly work with the people in business and agriculture themselves, some in government, health. Mr. and Mrs. Gates have done a superb job, also in Africa, in using experts that work directly with African farmers and businessmen to help them establish industries. They’ve done very very well. Also, I recommend something.</p> <p class=highlight>We have a Peace Corps. I think the United States should establish a Poverty Corps.</p> <p>College students just getting their BA, etcetera, or their Masters, are extremely interested in doing what they can in Africa and elsewhere to work there. A Poverty Corps of those kinds of students and retired people could play an extremely important role in Africa, and I mentioned it to Mr. Zoel lick and he agrees. He recommended it to his board but they refused. It was too radical for the time. It’s a paragraph or two in the article, the establishment of a Poverty Corps. I’d like to see that done. I wrote to Obama. I’d like Obama to do it, but he’s got such terrible problems to deal with. </p> <p>In Africa, they are developing common markets everywhere in Africa. They won’t do much good. Common markets between countries that produce practically similar products don’t go very far, and China is playing more and more role in Africa, with regard to development, but they are moving primarily into minerals, raw materials to export back to China. But, I find in many cases, it’s going to help, but China is playing a very important role in moving into those countries. Much of it much better than people think but also bad things. They don’t give a damn how corrupt the government is, or things like that, so you have negative elements too. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>So, you said that the scarcest resource in Sub-Saharan Africa was entrepreneurship but what might it be here?</em></p> <p>In the United States, I think the most important resource for the next 10 or 15 years is the efficiency of capital, the efficiency of capital in the best sense of the term. Human capital and physical. Namely, in the next 30 years, the greatest competition that we will be facing will be in the fields of those infrastructures where innovation of new products and services will play the major role. Therefore, in the United States, brilliance and training of the human agent and the transformation of it into the physical assets as well, so the efficiency of capital should keep increasing in regards to new products and services. That’s my view.</p> <p class=highlight>Human beings. Nobel prizes, that’s capital. Investment in people.</p> <p>That is the greatest shortage we are having today in technical, engineering, physics, chemistry, biotechnology. etcetera. Our universities have to make the greatest investment in human and physical capital. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>What do you think the government can do to promote that?</em></p> <p>Yes. I think that one of the greatest unfortunate things that happened during the great recession of 2008/2009, is the budget deficits that the states got into. Education is financed primarily by the states not the federal government. And in all the states, the budget deficits have been such that investments in education have been terribly reduced, for all the universities in virtually all the states. I think that one of the best things that the federal government can do, not only now but for the future, is to see that assistance is provided to the states to be able to maintain their investment in education and training. That, I think, is one of the most important. </p> <p>I also think that, in time, a bi-partisan commission should be formed to analyze the possibility of establishing an American infrastructure bank. We had the Tennessee Valley Authority, a company formed by the government, with complete independence. The government had nothing whatever to do with its running, its regulation, its management. They did a remarkable good job in the south with respect to energy. We need an American infrastructure bank. Namely, a bank that would make investments in forms of research, with regard to technology, with regard to health, with regard to such fields as bridges, roads, transportation. The United States ought to have a fast transportation system in, say, the whole area of the eastern United States should be better than that of Japan’s, or Germany’s, Holland’s. We’re like an underdeveloped country in that regard, and I think for a private company, it doesn’t pay to get into it because the profits don’t come fast enough. But a government, an American infrastructure bank, that makes more sense because it develops the whole region, taxes are increased and then it pays for itself, with particular emphasis on maintaining and increasing the efficiency of human, again, and physical capital investment. That, I think is where the government could play the major role, without the government having anything to do with running it or regulating it. That should be done by the best personnel we can get to manage it and run it. I think that’s essential. <br> <em class=interviewer>Would you say that one of the difficulties to enacting these measures that may be controversial is that elected officials are worried about getting reelected and tend to play it safe?</em></p> <p>Yes. I think there is no question whatsoever that policy formation in every field is being influenced, close to a definitive degree by the need for senators and congressmen to gather enough capital to be re elected. And realistically, they have to depend on it, and consequently, fear. The emphasis on financing one’s campaigns for both Democrats and Republicans has become paramount, and that’s playing, I’d say, a key element in the lack of decision-making process. At present, their ideologies are so divided that it’s practically impossible for them to reach compromises without the fear that they won’t get the primaries and get re elected. That’s a very serious problem in our country. </p> <p>There are many, many people, some good friends of mine, that have virtually given up on the future of the United States for that reason. I do not. I happen to believe that the diversification of this country is very great, and its history, a great one, that it will take time to get out of the present terrible divisive situation that exists. It is my belief that given the very unfortunate economic conditions that now exist, the unemployment rate probably will be high for the next two or three years. That under those conditions, it may very well be that enough of the American public will, I hope, once again, show the kind of reason that has been shown in the past, in electing people that are more reasonable as compared to those in the extreme ideological situation, where you have lunatic orthodoxy often dictating policy. </p> <p>Not to increase the debt ceiling is really a state of lunatic orthodoxy, or to establish a constitutional amendment that the country, the federal government should balance the budget every year. Because, as under President Hoover’s thinking, if you get into a recession, at that time, the government has less income and a budget deficit begins to develop. That’s called an automatic stabilizer, because government expenditures, unemployment expenditures are maintained but revenues drop, so effective demand slowly begins to rise. But if you say balance the budget, under those conditions, then that means reduce government expenditures. If you reduce government expenditures, you get more unemployment, revenue is reduced to the treasury and the budget deficit gets larger. If it gets larger, you say, well, you have to balance the budget. Cut expenditures again. The notion of balancing the budget every year, therefore, is lunatic orthodoxy. A country such as ours should balance the budget but through a cycle, through a whole, say 7, 8 years. Not every year. For the longer term, I think <br> the US will regain its tempo and expansion and political improvement will keep increasing. I am optimistic, although the process, as you’ve said, will be extremely slow and difficult. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>Will you explain a bit about what you mean by value patterns?</em></p> <p>By value patterns I mean, a feeling of the people that they are genuine members of society with equal opportunity and a lack of corruption in the judicial system. But when the income distribution greatly deteriorates as it has in our country recently, people feel that equality among individuals is not being adhered to, that the tax system and the economy is working just very much for the rich, and minority groups, black students, younger ones, don’t have equal opportunities, and then murder in Oakland occurs more and more. The value pattern of the country, of Me-ism, lack of responsibility politically, of compromising, of reaching agreement, of honesty in discussions, and the movement of ideology takes extremes. You get Madoffs. After all, the greatest corruption the world has ever seen. Over 50 billion dollars. I think that fair play, at one time, mattered, and I hope still is one of the key ingredients of this country. </p> <p>In the last two or three generations, the element of time has become much less important. The question of how important it is to maintain your value pattern, that if you say you’ll be there at 2:00, you’ll be there at 2:00, virtually doesn’t exist. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>It may be outlandish to ask about any future decline in nationalism or the possibility of nations more and more united, resembling a single government or fewer governments, but do you see that as a trend in the next 50 years, th</em>increase in umbrella organizations that coordinate internationally… the work of the United Nations, etcetera? </p> <p>No. I don’t. I think that there’s been a great deal of exaggeration of the notion of the non-nation-state. There has been a lot of discussion that communications are so increased that the nation-state will become less important. Now, let me be careful. I think, first, the great recession of 2008/2009 has played an important role, not only in increasing the pace of the United State’s reduction of its influence in the world, because before the great recession of 2008/2009, the collapse of communism convinced many people that the Washington experience, as it’s called, in other words, American private capitalism is the future for the whole world. Fukuyama wrote a book on it, the End of History, and that that was practically ensured, that private capitalism would be the future and the nation-state would become less and less important. I think that was an error in the sense that, though it is true that in Europe you had the common market, nevertheless, the last 30 years, whenever a technical issue came up and it was provided for the people to vote on it, the people were wrong. I very much dislike saying this, because up to about 10 years ago I believed the opposite. </p> <p>I believed that you could nearly always rely upon the good judgment of the electorate. I think that is true when the issues are not technical. In the last 30 years, as I mentioned, in Europe and the United States, whenever a technical issue was given to the electorate to decide upon, they were wrong on the decision. So in Europe, you had the European common market but when they had to vote to establish a unification politically of Europe, they voted against it. It didn’t go through. And I found that to be true on virtually every technical issue in our country as well. </p> <p>Moreover, because of the great recession, central tendencies, say of Belgium, for the European community, greatly reduced in importance, and every nation began to act more according to its own national will, national wishes and needs. So since 2008/2009, confidence in an unregulated capitalist system that was the image of a great deal of the world has virtually disappeared the world over, and nationalism is increased. That every country is behaving more nationalistically rather than less as compared to previously. Therefore, I believe that insofar as the nation-state is concerned and its future, the notion of no nation-state barriers, that’s nonsense. It will not happen. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>Do you think that scholars are consulted by the government to the extent that they once were? Has that changed?</em></p> <p>That’s changed tremendously. Say 50 years ago and more, there was a group of people in the country, non-political, and they were members, as far as one knew of both the Republican and Democratic parties that provided a set of judgments and opinions that were practically published every day in the newspapers and listened to by the entire country. They, in fact, formed a non-political, realistic, responsible class of citizens that expressed their judgments on key issues of national affairs, and were listened to by the congress, by the press, etcetera. That’s virtually disappeared. It practically doesn’t exist today. At the moment, we have a Council of Economic Advisors and the National Economic Council which is practically not even heard of. You’d ask most people and they wouldn’t even know who the chairmen were. This has greatly deteriorated, in this case, particularly recently. It’s very important that universities should provide the leadership for that kind of judgment, when the need today is so great. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>You mention, in your book <a href=https://www.mqup.ca/crises-and-compassion-products-9780773538207.php rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Crises and Compassion</a>, you [write] about your father’s disposition and his way of dealing with conflict, and I found that set the stage for you to talk about your history of relationships. So, what do you see as the lessons you take away from your father?</em></p> <p>That’s a very interesting point, and I think that you’re right. My father was a dictator. The truth is, I did not love my father. I respected him because he was a brilliant person. But the background from Russia was such that there was never any civility of discussion with him. It was always dictatorial, ‘You do this. The position on this is this.’ And nonetheless, a surprising thing happened. When I was four years of age, as I discuss in the book, he had a wonderful young Russian woman come to teach me how to read and write Russian, arithmetic, etc. Now this was a surprising phenomenon because my father was very very tight with money and he’d have to pay her. Therefore, I had to conclude, he came to the conclusion (because this was always crucial for him) that the yield will pay off, that an investment in me by a good teacher, would be worthwhile. No sentiment. </p> <p>And as I state in the book, as a kid, I wanted to play. So whenever she came, I didn’t want to appear like a sissy so I would say, “Huh. That bitch, she’s here again,” to prove I could out swear any Russian. I would come in and she would read Pushkin to me, the great Russian author for children.</p> <p class=highlight>The truth is that I fell in love with her.</p> <p>So on the one hand, you had this tremendous impact, again, when you don’t have civility of discussion between parents and children, the impact that it could have upon a character. </p> <p>And secondly, the other part, the teacher that I mentioned, she played such a fundamental role in my life, from the age of 5 on. I believe that her impact in that regard was another force that instilled in me a love of books, a love of reading, and getting along with people in a convivial way, that she, as the adverse to that situation with respect to my father, played a fundamental role for the rest of my life. A good deal if not the most important education occurs between the relationship of parents and their children, even before they go to school. </p> <p>And of course, when you are in a recession, as we are in today, even though we are out of it, you have the view that it may not be wise to spend the time and the money to go to college. Many students who speak to me now say that. I think they are making the biggest mistake. Because the heart of going on for graduate work in greater education is not necessarily the fact that you’ll be able to make more money. Of course they will. </p> <p>Even now, students who have a BA degree and are over 25, have an unemployment rate of only 4%, whereas the unemployment rate in the country as a whole is 9.2. Dropouts have unemployment at 25%. So that the aspect of education and higher income is true, but that is not the fundamental aspect of it. The fundamental aspect of higher education, more education, that the students often want to pursue, even when conditions are as bad as they are, is that it gives them more alternatives in their life, than anything else. </p> <p><em class=interviewer>Well, that brings me to the question of what you’re working on these days.</em></p> <p>I have one more book in my mind, in my head. I’m 92 years old, as you know. And there are two fields that I’ve worked in all my life. One was international economic policy and theory and the other was the history of economic analysis. And two presses have asked me to put together articles that I’ve published in the history of economic thought into a book, and I’m considering doing that. It would be called the <em>New History of Economic Thought</em>, by which I mean, covering the period from mercantilism, 1550 to the present, and to examine in each case, what did the economists of the period state were the key issues in their countries and how well they addressed them. </p> <p>For example, I began the first chapter on this, which I am finishing called <em>Mass Unemployment Under Mercantilism, 1550 – 1750, as a Condition of Early Capitalism</em>, and here’s what I found: 3 great economists of the 20th century — Professor Heckscher from Sweden, Professor Viner from Chicago, and Professor Schumpeter from Harvard, virtually disregarded the problem of mass unemployment under mercantilism. And I ask myself how these economists could have disregarded that important issue. One, the technical knowledge did not exist to explain mass unemployment, either contemporary or historical. Second, they were conservatives interested in long run equilibrium analysis, so they underestimated the importance of unemployment. I find it incredible that such a situation should occur and the economics profession didn’t recognize it. </p> <p>However, I should say that when John Maynard Keynes published his <em>General Theory</em> in 1936, it dealt primarily with mass unemployment. Thereafter, Heckscher and Viner, reappraised their analysis of mass unemployment in the mercantilist period. </p> <p class=highlight>This illustrates how, with new technical knowledge, we reappraise every period in history. By this process, every generation must write its own economics.</p> <p>You asked the question, there’s the answer.</div> </div></main> <footer class="text-center font-light py-2"><div class="text-center mt-8"><span class="svelte-7t4bue mr-4"><a href="https://twitter.com/specimen_mag?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank><img alt=twitter class=svelte-7t4bue src=twitter.svg></a></span> <span class=svelte-7t4bue><a href=https://www.instagram.com/specimenmagazine/ rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank><img alt=instagram class=svelte-7t4bue src=instagram.svg></a></span></div> <small class="block my-2">Specimen Magazine © 2011 - 2015</small> </footer></div>
