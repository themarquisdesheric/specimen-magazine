In this issue, mathematical physicist <a href="/interviews/nicolai-reshetikhin">Nicolai Reshetikhin</a> dwells on the age old question, <em>what is math anyway?</em> Is it just a construction of our minds or did we discover these patterns in nature, already perfect and orderly? Is math more like "reading the book of life" (<a href="/interviews/bernd-sturmfels">Bernd Sturmfels</a>) or more like writing it?<br /><br />\n  Computer scientist <a href="/interviews/umesh-vazirani">Umesh Vazirani</a> describes the <em>computational lens</em>, a mathematical way of unlocking the secrets of nature, how we co-evolved with our math machines over just a few generations, and how quantum computing introduces complexity on a scale that we cannot fathom. Theoretical astrophysicist <a href="/interviews/eliot-quataert">Eliot Quataert</a> explains how simplifying the cosmos down to workable problems (numbers) is a tricky art, and "if you do it wrong, you will throw away the essential bit of the problem that is needed to understand the observations."<br /><br />\n  There is also important concern about the impulse to quantify, and measure, and elevate data over other values. Biologist and 2013 Nobel laureate <a href="/interviews/randy-schekman">Randy Schekman</a> explains how the number of citations generated by a paper in an academic journal, its “impact factor," has been elevated to the gold standard of worth in the sciences and how damaging that turn to flashy headlines has been. He is heading up a new journal to restore integrity to science publishing.<br /><br />\n  The interviews also touch on the personal choice to pursue math and science in the first place. Why is math still so dominated by white guys when it\'s supposed to be the ultimate meritocracy? As <a href="/interviews/robion-kirby">Rob Kirby</a> puts it, when you\'ve got math skills, “there is no way to take you down.” If you think you know where you stand on affirmative action, dare to read on.<br /><br />\n  The subtitle of this issue could be “the time I decided to become a mathematician." It is a familiar story about how hard I fall for the subject matter in the latest issue.

We started with some vague curiosity about the alternative farming movement and were quickly reminded that we know very little about mainstream farming practices. The quest to understand the bigger picture resulted in this collection of interviews.<br /><br />\n  Our coverage is an overrepresentation of subjects who are part of the “farm movement” in the Midwest — what many of us still know of as a quaint, feel-good, foodie, niche market — and an underrepresentation of subjects who are part of the system of larger, industrial farms, the means by which most of us subsist these days.<br /><br />\n  It is not our intention to frame the discussion as an either/or side-taking opportunity. You, dear reader, are encouraged to resist the urge and simply enjoy the fascinating and alarming foreignness of our food system — foreign like a chicken paw, like algal blooms, like sitting in a combine on Christmas Eve, like $.09/lb. pork, like buying lettuce from the Department of Defense.<br /><br /> \n  These interviews are journeys through dark, sad places and green pastures, rain storms, droughts, sunbursts and orgasmics. You will clearly understand, and then wonder at, and then understand again, why anyone would ever want to be a farmer.<br /><br />\n  Thank you for reading.<br /><br />\n  Abby McLean\n  <hr />\n  Specimen is a periodic magazine featuring candid, in-depth interviews with professors and other expert types for everyday people. Specimen interviews are not embedded in written narratives. What you read is transcript material from real conversations and monologues — straight from the horse\'s mouth — because word choice matters.
