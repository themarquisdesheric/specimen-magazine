<em class="interviewer">Interview conducted July 20th, 2011 at David's Lafayette home.</em>

David Aldous, a math nerd. As the accent shows, I am from England, went through Cambridge University in the 70s, came to Berkeley as an assistant professor in '79 and stayed. So there you are. That's the short version. I do mathematical probability, so almost all of which is not interesting to anyone else as a sort of technical speciality, you know. In recent years, I've gotten interested in what are the connections between what we think about and teach as mathematicians and what in the real world — I hate using a phrase like "real world," because what does it mean, but it's the best that I can come up with, you know.

The math traditionally started with throwing dice and tossing coins, certain very special things like this the math works fine for, and that's why casinos make money, etcetera, but most of what we think about in life is uncertainty about the future, course it's nothing like casino games, and the issue is whether mathematics has anything to say about that. So that's hopefully the 
more interesting side of what I think about, but it's all stuff that I'm not actually any academic expert on, maybe nobody is an academic expert on. 

<em class="interviewer">Why might no one be an expert on that? Is it just too new of a field?</em>

It's not new. It's just too vague. In other words, academic life goes through things you can teach, things you can research on. That's all sort of... definite things. It's kind of like if you look at physics books, they say a lot about gravity and not much about friction. Even though everything you actually need to know about gravity for everyday life you say in a paragraph. Friction is much more complicated because it's sort of not amenable to nice math. Those sort of physicists tend to think of gravity or black holes or things that hopefully are amenable to math rather than lots of actual physical phenomenon. They sort of ignore it and say that's engineering, that's metallurgy, or something else. So there's a kind of selection. You want to teach definite things to students so you need to do research on definite things and not on rather vague things.

<em class="interviewer">So what are you working on, what have you been working on most recently?</em>

The technical stuff I do tends to be, again... hard to explain. One background is the theory of algorithms, the rules by which computers actually do things. The software people are actually writing code. The code is the actual thing but there's some algorithms and logical rules that the code is implementing. And some of the algorithms, both the sort of routing of the internet at one very practical level but even more, all the mundane things an operating system does like being able to find a file when you ask for a file. Somebody at some point had to think about efficient ways of doing that and the first ways you think of tend not to be the most efficient. So there's some rather elaborate theory. The theory is probably much more elaborate than what's actually being used but there's elaborate theory on how to keep the million or so files that everyone has on their laptop. Most of them you don't actually see because they are part of the inner workings of it, but it's how you actually organize those so that you can find things when you need them. So that's one area of technical work.

Mostly mathematicians are sort of playing around and not doing anything very real. You are setting up rules for how hypothetical systems might work and you are then trying to see if you can mathematically prove what their behavior's going to be in terms of the given rules. So there's a big difference. So if you think about something like chess, there's a difference between understanding the rules of chess and understanding how chess actually works, how to play it well. So mathematicians tend to study systems defined by a few simple-sounding rules and then try to figure out what happens when you actually run the system.

<em class="interviewer">So, you write a bit about the everyday applications of probability and perception.</em>

Yeah, so that's probably what's more interesting to talk about. I got into this about 10 years ago when without thinking I sort of volunteered to teach a course with this title *Probability in the Real World* without having any plan of teaching something 9 months in advance, and then sort of realized that it's much harder to think of what to say in such a course. Teaching mathematics, the mathematics somehow… teaches itself isn't the right way of saying it, but because it's a logical structure, you have definitions, and theorems, and proofs. And they may have been hard originally for anyone to work these out. But once it's there, there's a sort of a logical structure you can go through and the stuff itself is somehow just there. It's like teaching someone how to build or repair a car. The car is actually there. You don't have to invent it.

Trying to think broadly about probability in the real world, it's much less clear what it is you want to talk about. It's easy to think of the 10 standard things academics know. But the issue is how much more is there, and the standard things are always done by oversimplified models, so in terms of what the mathematics tells you you can actually get money on if the predictions are accurate, it's much harder to find good examples.

One of the fun things I thought about and got data on is: in what context ordinary people in everyday life think about chance. So that's probably the interesting question. 15 years ago it would have been very hard to think of any way of answering that other than by going and trying to ask people. And then you kind of have the elephant problem. Because if I want to know in what context you think about elephants, somehow it doesn't work to just ask you in what context you think about elephants because A) you don’t know, and B) I sort of put the idea into your mind and that maybe biases it.

So to figure out in what context people think about chance, we now have sort of two ways of doing it that we didn't have 15 years ago. First, you can search people's blogs and you see where, on their own initiative, where words of chance come up. So we have some data on that. And also because I spent a year away at Microsoft, the year before the immediate past one. I got someone to give me the file of all the 100,000 queries ever made to the search engine Bing containing the phrase "chance of" or "probability of.” Search engines keep every query they ever made. They are somewhat anonymized, at least in what they gave to me. It wasn't identifying a person Obviously they need that to see how well they’re doing. Google and Bing are sort of interested in where you actually go on the internet after you've typed in a search phrase. Both to make their searches better and because they are selling the advertising. So all of this is kept a record of, somewhat anonymized.

Anyway, so you have this data, so you see what people care about. And of course it's very different from what we teach in textbooks on math probability. So it turns out that about half the chance queries have to do with health and medicine broadly, later, and about half of those have to do with birth control and pregnancy, so you know all this stuff is funny because once you see it, you realize what's going on, or at least you guess this is a kind of middle of the night panic.

In the middle of the night, you actually want to know something because you're going to a search engine rather than something else. Then there are actually sensible questions about cancers. If you are diagnosed with a certain cancer, what are the chances of surviving. So you have sensible questions and you have then totally off the wall questions.

Academics don't do research on this because it's hard to know what the actual bottom line is. So to me it's fascinating to just look at this. It's like looking at a picture, but you don't get tenure thinking about this stuff because what is it you could you say about it that would impress anybody? That's kind of the advantage of being old in the academic world. You can do what you like and not care if other people think you're crazy. People sort of think I'm crazy doing this. Always people on the math side, because it's not math. But I don't care.

On a philosophical level, once you start thinking about it, it's very hard to figure out. In some sense, everything interesting about the future is uncertain. You can predict the times of sunrise and sunset in 20 years. But those are boring things. What's going to happen to you and me personally, the state of the world in 20 or 30 years... all the interesting parts of that are uncertain. Yes, sometimes we think in terms of chance and sometimes we don't think in terms of chance. And the more you think about this, the weirder it is.

<em class="interviewer">You mention that you see a problem with the everyday claim that the position we are born into is a matter of luck at all. And I thought that was really interesting, something we take for granted.</em>

Oh. Ok. You're now getting into the very philosophical, speculative philosophy. People argue endlessly about what, philosophically, what is probability? What does it mean when you say that something has a 70% chance? So there are endless arguments about this sort of stuff. My take is that there has to be a person, an actual person, saying this, or at least a hypothetical observer saying this, for probability to make sense. So even though, in an informal sense, we all say that we're lucky to be born in the West in the 20th century and not in some other place in some other time, the trouble is that then we wouldn't be ourselves. So there isn't actually a person able to make this probability assertion about something that isn't known. So, I'm sort of claiming that things like that don't really make sense, except in some informal sense. 

And one thing, again, bizarrely, that philosophers do actually attempt to talk seriously about is the simulation idea, which is that… Ok. So we're now backing into weird stuff. In jargon, the Fermi Paradox is that we actually have, we see no evidence of intelligent extraterrestrials with technology. So, the sounding point is just there's no general accepted evidence of any technological extraterrestrials out there. Because, non-technological ones you wouldn't have any evidence of, so that kind of doesn't count. So you now have various explanations of this. And there is a very fun book, actually. It goes through, in a sort of serious and popular way, 50 possible explanations for this. And it comes down to, what it really comes down to, is either the actual evolution of humans or intelligent technological species that happened on earth, maybe this is just such an incredibly unlikely thing to happen that it only happened here. 

So that's one possibility, which people take seriously. Scientists are predisposed not to like that. Because they don't like/want to think of things in terms of unlikely things as having happened. Scientists like to think that well, ok, obviously Earth may be special in some ways but it can't really be that special.

Since the universe is a huge place, for that to happen on Earth, there should be something similar happening in other places. So basically it comes down to either Earth is incredibly special or lucky that intelligent life didn’t arise anywhere else or, of course, it did arise somewhere else and we just don't see it. Now you can have great fun speculating on how it might be that there are some technological civilizations out there that we don't see. Pessimists tend to think, well, they just kill themselves off by nuclear war or climate change or whatever the currently perceived threat is. You can have huge numbers of science fictionish ideas. So science fiction itself has lots of ideas about this and scientists have other ideas. And it's all pure speculation. 

So I was off on a tangent. I was going to get to one of these sort of crazy and philosophical things, which is that most of us think there's some chance of there being more advanced technological civilizations out there. So if you assign any chance except zero to that, you then get the idea that since we can do rather crude virtual reality simulations, they'll be able to do essentially perfect virtual reality simulations of anything they like, of any artificial universe. And again, we can run millions of things, they'll be able run billions of things. So now we have this issue. What we see here could be what we think it is or we could be in a simulation run by extraterrestrials. You now have a math calculation that somebody is trying to do with probability. 

Somehow, whatever the probabilities are, because they could be running billions and billions of copies, you could do a sort of hand waving argument that says we are much more likely to be in a simulation than in the real world.

Now, of course arguments like this are of course ridiculous, but the philosophical issue 
lous, but the philosophical issue is why exactly are they ridiculous? It's less hard to pin down why they're ridiculous. That's something that philosophers do actually think about occasionally. But again, my answer is somehow, in order to think about probabilities, you really need some definite standing point relative to what you know or what you assume. So kind of comparing two different possibilities. In some sense, it's just a more fancy smoke and mirrors version of just asking, how do we know that we are awake and not dreaming? We actually don't. But it just isn't useful to go through life thinking about the possibility that you're just dreaming at the moment.

<em class="interviewer">How important do you think it is to collaborate with others?</em>

Mathematicians have switched, kind of over my lifetime. One could probably look up data, but I'm guessing probably about 25 years ago, they kind of crossed the line. These things happened slowly of course, but before 25 years ago, most math papers would have been single-author, and now it's switched over to most math papers being collaborations. The combination of email and TeX system suddenly made it, on this mundane, practical level of writing and editing, much easier to first write longer papers and collaborate with other people.

I'm a bit of a cynic. Somewhere, I actually have it at work, I have a little fridge magnet with a picture, a sort of cheerful 1950s style housewife saying, "Drink more coffee, do stupid things faster with more energy." So that's actually my metaphor, because it's easier to do this. Things happen more quickly but they tend to be small variants of other stuff. So there's vastly more papers being written. You also have the arXive. People write papers and they immediately post them somewhere without them having gone through peer review or an official publication. So all these things mean that the number written a year has probably gone up by a... I'm exaggerating, probably gone up by a factor of 3 since I started in 79, even though the number of people involved has probably gone up a little but it hasn't gone up so much. So roughly speaking, I think there are twice as many papers per person being written than 30 years ago. But, it's kind of... the average paper is being written twice as much. There aren't twice as many good papers.

Maybe because there is more communication. There's some fine line between slightly new ideas and really, really new ideas. That is, an idea comes along, someone has an idea, and if there are fairly natural consequences of it, then in modern life, it takes about 2 years for someone to think of the consequence of someone else's work rather than 1 year. So, on this fairly small and incremental scale, things happen more quickly, but also the really important ideas are the ones that don't just follow from other ideas, they are sort of new thoughts that are not immediate consequences of existing stuff. And somehow the modern technology doesn't do anything to make completely new thoughts come out more quickly.

To some extent, it actually mitigates against it because you have all this sort of bustle of activity and you have less of the being able to sort of sit quietly in your study and think about new and different ideas. So I'm a bit of a skeptic about to what extent the modern way of doing things actually makes theoretical knowledge grow. I'm skeptical about the technology actually helping with important new conceptual ideas coming along. I think with anything, with any level of practical development it helps, but with the beginnings of ideas, I think it doesn't help.


<em class="interviewer">Now, do you find that you or other professors in your community are consulted by politicians in any serious way?</em>

Right. For a typical mathematician, no. I'm in the Statistics Department so people on the statistics side who want to get involved in consulting can do it, and there are various levels. On the governmental level, yes, several of my older colleagues have been involved in this ongoing census adjustment debate. So basically, every 10 years there's a census and every 10 years there's some argument about… we sort of know we're missing 1% of the population and you also have some idea of the types of people that you're missing. So, the answer then is that you can do a statistical adjustment trying to guess as well as you can who you are missing. And of course the words of the Constitution, whatever they are, kind of refer to an actual count. So you have constitutional issues as well as the arguments, of course they are all self-motivated particular arguments. Nothing's of any principle whatsoever. So there's an actual sort of political fight based on political self-interest of the Democrats and Republicans. This fight is sort of disguised as sort of legal and statistical and constitutional arguments.

If you ask a statistician, in fact one of my friends in England proposed this and of course got shot down, it would work much better to run the census as a sample. The actual idea of trying to count everybody, from a scientific point of view, is a kind of a crazily inefficient way to doing it.

<p class="highlight">
  One of the best rules of statistics is that a smaller amount of good data is much more useful than a lot of bad data.
</p>

So, making an effort to randomly sample 10% of the population and ask them a lot of questions… it happens at the moment that there is a short form and a long form on the census, but the information on the short form, somehow you don't need to send that to everybody. You can get just as much information if you send it to 10% of the population. And again, with the long form, it's effectively doing this random sampling all over again.

Yeah, so we are not on the government's radar. Math is so small in the science community. The money in the sciences is kind of in the labs. More than half of science is biology and medicine, so the high school course listing, where people typically said sort of math, physics, chemistry, biology, in that order, kind of has it exactly backwards in size and prominence. All the science is in biology and medicine. Physicists have sort of conned people into supporting their big cyclotrons and things and spending lots of money on that. There's money there. Whether it's the best use of money… like the manned space program is a sort of a vast waste of money… from a scientific point of view.

Math departments are kind of like dentists. People recognize they're necessary so you actually… there is no particular motivation to anyone with a dental school for saying, oh let's save money and close down a dental school or something. So math departments trundle along because sort of everyone just perceives they are part of the background and doesn't pay too much attention to them, mostly. 

Now things have gotten more interesting. So I say, sort of humorously to my graduate students, that Luke Skywalker only had one dark side to tempt him, but you are going to have 3 dark sides. So, one is hedge funds, of course, all the math finance, or Wall Street. The second one being Microsoft, Google, Facebook, all that world, which uses... Google's based on algorithms, so they are sort of more serious about math than IBM or AT&T were a generation ago. And thirdly, the world's biggest supplier of mathematicians. Can you guess? The National Security Agency. Nobody knows of course, by nature. The NSA has an immense amount of mathematicians doing that. I humorously call them all branches of the evil empire, especially when I was working at Microsoft, of course. (wild laughter) 

<em class="interviewer">Ok. Versus global evil, how can statistics help alleviate global needs? How is it working on a large scale?</em>

David: Oh, ok.
