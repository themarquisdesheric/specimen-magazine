<em class="interviewer">Maybe you can start by talking a little bit about your education.</em>
 
Well, I grew up in an army family as an only child, so, during the formative years, we moved and moved and moved and moved. My mother and father were extremely interested in my education. With some dispute over which Ivy League school it was that I should go to. I went to Yale, which is where my father got his masters, following his undergraduate degree from West Point, which was 1924. I had picked Yale because I thought there was value to a general broad education, even though I knew I was interested in Chemical Engineering. And then, for graduate work, the idea was I should go to some place that focused very especially on what I was interested in, and <p class="highlight">All the textbooks had been written by people who were at MIT, so I went to MIT</p> and got a doctorate from there in 1960, with the last year of that being simultaneous with my first job, which was to direct a school of Chemical Engineering Practice School station at what was the Bayway Refinery in New Jersey. That was a novel form of education that MIT had. Instead of a masters degree for masters students they had students go out to these industrial locations with an MIT faculty member, which I was for two years, on hand to find good problem areas for them to work on, interface with the company, and so forth. And then, after that, I knew that I wanted a faculty position and I chose between two places. One was a brand new program in chemical engineering at the state University of NY, at Buffalo, where they kept recruiting me by saying they tried to model themselves on the University of California at Berkeley. The other opportunity was the University of California at Berkeley. Why not go to the place they want to model on rather than to their own place? That's how I got here in 1963, 48 years ago. 
 
<em class="interviewer">When did you first get involved with the Center for Studies in Higher Education?</em>

The center here? That was after my entire career which had been all the Chemical Engineering stuff, research, which I kept going quite late into the game. I was doing research, supervision, and university administration at the same time for a number of years. So, after I had done all that, and after I had done various administrative positions, ending up being provost for the system… you can only take that kind of schedule for so many years, and I had done it for nine and a half, and there was to be a turnover in the presidency from Dick Atkinson to Bob Dynes, so did I really want to undertake more years with a new president, and I came to the decision before I even talked with Dynes that I’d really like to move on to another phase of my career and not have every moment spoken for.

So that then raised the question of what to do next. The essential choice was going back into chemical engineering, where I had only been out of the research world for 5 years, and pick it up again and go forward, or make use of all these university administrative posts and the experience I had gained in them. And the latter made sense. The Berkeley campus came to me and they’d been having a search for some years, with ups and downs to it, for somebody to lead this center. I decided, that's the way to make use of all of this accumulated experience in various higher ed. administrative posts, and would actually be intriguing and interesting to me. Although I took retirement at the point of leaving the provost position, I am on what is called a recall appointment here. I think the ingredients in me are somebody who is a scholar by nature and at heart, plus a wealth of accumulated experience. Put that together to try to do research related to the accumulated experience. And to make it more interesting, the crisis of funding public education has arrived and is boiling away right now, so that certainly gives us issues to work on. 
 
<em class="interviewer">Would you mind talking more about that? Is it directly related to the economy or are there other factors going on, with this decline in public funding?</em>
 
<p class="highlight">It's a complex situation but I don't think the funding of public education by governments is going to spring back to where it once was. I think we’ve had permanent changes.</p>And the ingredients of this, put in a nutshell.... the United States is rather unusual among countries by having its public universities be creatures of the individual states rather than of the country. Here in the U.S., the University of California reports to the California state government, the University of Texas reports to the Texas state government, etcetera. And so, factor #1 is that our universities in the public arena belong to the states. Factor #2 is state budgets have gotten extremely pressed, and they are pressed for many reasons. One is the difficulty of raising income, because of the unpopularity of new taxes, or higher taxes. Another is the ever-mounting costs relating to health care, which are burdens of the state. Another in California is locking up the state budget. So, we pass propositions in California, and they tend to say that the state must do this even without generating the money to do this, whatever it is, or they are a restriction on something, like Proposition 98, years ago, which said that a certain fraction of the state budget must go to the school system, or they are limitations on income such as old Proposition 13, from decades ago, which placed a cap on what can be derived from property taxes.

So there is in California, something like a little less than 20% of the state budget that is actually manipulable by the state government. The rest is just locked in statute as to what it shall do. So, the three big things that are in that slightly less than 20% are all of public higher education, which means UC, CSU, and all of the community colleges, the state money for the community colleges, prisons and various welfare programs. So those three are left to compete against one other with only a small portion of the budget to work with. The result of that has been that the state contribution to higher education as a percentage of the state budget has gone down and down as other things arise that present needs, and state money as a percentage of the total budget of a university like the University of California has gone way down. 

So, the result of that is that public higher education is left either looking for sources of income, new sources of income, larger sources of income that aren’t state money, or cutting back its program, and there are states that have gone the route of the public university charging high tuition for out of state and foreign students and just reducing the percentage of in-state residents that go to the university. But in California, that will not work because the California public values a UC education, hugely, therefore they want to maximize the number of Californians who can get into it. And to reduce services to the state, such as by getting a whole lot of high fee paying students from other countries and other states, is just not a popular thing here — nor does it make a lot of sense for public education if it's supposed to educate the public of California. 

So these are the essential issues and the university is searching and turning in many directions on that — relations with industry and all of the concerns we can have about keeping companies from exerting undue influence on the university. Over the last 30 years the public universities have turned big towards private fund raising, so the Berkeley campus itself came a few years ago out of a 2 billion dollar capital campaign, billion with a b. And I can think back to around 1980, and at that point, the university didn't really have a development office even. Development offices are what support the fundraising effort, so it's been a relatively recent phenomenon. And it's very consumptive on the time of the chancellors. They will spend half or more of their time out there raising money. There is the long answer to a short question on what is the crisis of public education. 
 
<em class="interviewer">How do these ballot initiatives work in? Are these anomalies or are they happening more frequently that you see?</em>
 
I moved here in 1963, and what was happening in the ballot initiative world then was very very different. What happens now is that it takes a certain number of signatures to put an initiative on the ballot or the legislature has to decide and vote to put it on the ballot, but most of them come by gathering the signatures. So what happens is that you go to the supermarket or you go to REI or wherever you might shop, and you will find somebody sitting at a table out front. And as you go in they say something like, ‘Do you like the environment?,’ something to which the answer is surely ‘Yes,’ and then they try to get your signature. And they are in fact, those people are paid signature collectors. So getting an issue, an initiative on the ballot is a matter of spending the money that is required to pay the signature collectors to collect the requisite number of signatures. That’s a trend of the last few decades, that one effectively buys one’s way onto the ballot by that mechanism.

And then there is the issue of how these initiatives are phrased as the campaign goes on. My experience, over the last few decades has been that from the advertising, you can't really recognize what the initiative is about. The advertising may or may not, and probably does not completely focus on the substance of the initiative itself, and in a sense, that is another way of spending money to get something passed. So there are a lot of interest groups, and they have reasons to get things passed, and so they do. That is sort of the jaundiced view of the state initiative system. There are a number of public forums right now, like the New America Foundation and even part of the activities of the Commonwealth Club that are trying to straighten out this situation and make it work better, rather than being as much as it is a world of spending money and getting a result on the ballot by having spent that money. 

<em class="interviewer">Would you mind talking about the intersection [of] universities and corporations and where you think that’s headed?</em>

Well, that has been an area of substantial change and it’s something that I’ve had a lot of involvement with over the years. In fact, I was one of the 7 or 8 founders of something called the Council for Chemical Research, which was put into operation back in the very early 1980s, and was an organization of both chemical companies and universities with an aim to trying to find ways to enable and foster appropriate relations and interactions between companies in that industry and universities. I even had some research of my own that was sponsored by a corporation. 

So, I think two things, I think many things but two of them are that, it is important to enable interactions and exchange of thoughts between corporations and companies, otherwise the university, which is trying to do research of a comprehensive sort in the full worldwide and public arena, is missing some important input that it might have, so it was useful to me, in designing my own research in chemical engineering to have direct knowledge of what corporate needs, desires, interests, what were big problems in industry, things that might be addressed through research of a sort that was fundamental for doing in a university. I differentiate that from the sort of thing that would be done by a corporate research department within a company, where they’re going to look at the world of research accomplishments out there, take a few things, and run further with them because they believe they are very close to the interests of the company. This would be a matter of doing what one does in academic research, which is trying to build a related body of knowledge, a coordinated, related body of knowledge that builds and feeds upon itself. In effect, you are building the garden from which the companies would pick particular things in order to pursue them further. And if I’ve got to build that garden, I’ve got to know something about what those companies are interested in. So I would first of all say that it’s very important to have the interactions and the contacts. 

The second thing is that since the corporate world is for profit, and money is a huge factor, you then have to be very careful that you have appropriate guidelines, constraints, and policies, to keep some kind of conflict of interest situation or inappropriate diversion of university effort to a company from occurring. 

In a number of posts that I was in, we would concern ourselves at various times with policies for creating that envelope within which the faculty could work. So, policies on conflict of interest: if you are going to apply for research support from a company, where you also have some kind of financial interest, such as, you consult or you own some substantial percentage of the stock, then that proposed arrangement has to be looked at by a confidential and totally independent set of faculty from various quarters around the university to make sure it’s ok, that it’s within standards. So that would be conflict of interest. Conflict of commitment is another thing we care about, which is essentially what are you worried about when you wake up in the morning and get ready to come to work. Are you worrying about your university work or are you worrying about some company in which you are involved? So we have rules saying you cannot be an officer of a company. We have rules saying you may have leave for one or at most two years at the most to do something in the corporate world before you make a decision about which it is you’re going to do in the future. So, you can’t just have a continued leave to work in the corporate world. We have rules with regard to publishing results of research; it has to be published. 

We do have technology transfer offices that recognize that the results of some of the research in a university does have commercial value. Therefore, it’s worthwhile for the university to get patents on that research. There is something called the Bayh-Dole Act. The Bayh-Dole Act of about 1980 did say that ownership of intellectual property from research that was done through government grants to the universities, lies with the university. So, therefore, the university has a way to create ownership of inventions. It has been variable as a revenue source for universities. In most universities, it’s not much of a revenue source. Some have had some big winners that have made it a significant revenue source in some places. Then the university technology transfer office is concerned with licensing of that technology to corporations that would like to have it. And so the corporation can then pay a revenue, a royalty, for the use of that invention. The university gets the royalty as income, and several things are done with that money. One of the first things that’s done is to pay the expenses of the office that does the technology transfer. So, it’s a source of income for that. It is also money that goes flexibly into the overall university budget. And then the system here at UC and the campuses each have policies with regard to the distribution of licensing revenues and how much they would send back to the colleges and schools and departments of the faculty members whose invention it was that got licensed. And then a certain amount goes to the faculty member, to give them incentive to participate in the patenting process. 

<p class="highlight">I have to say though, backing off on all of this, my first statement is important, which is that research becomes sterile if you don’t have knowledge of what the needs are there in the corporate world. The university does need that knowledge. It’s intellectually beneficial to all to have interactions in professional society meetings or wherever.</p>But on the other hand, there are legitimate reasons for being concerned that there might be improper corporate influence on a university, and therefore, we have a large number of rules, and regulations, and policies on this. 

<em class="interviewer">It’s amazing that it works.</em>

It’s a very complicated world, that is correct. And keeps a lot of people busy. It also has been vital to the employment and economic growth of the United States. A vivid example sits right here in the San Francisco Bay area.
<p class="highlight">We had Silicon Valley sprout where it is. That had everything to do with the existence of Stanford but also the UC campuses in the area, access to and interactions with these faculty members, and then more recently, the biotech industry arrived here and that had everything to do with the universities here and the desires of the companies to draw on them.</p>
The next wave is what is called nanotechnology which is very small-scale designs and devices on the level of collections of atoms, and that industry gives every prospect of growing in this area too because the Bay Area has been able to foster a climate of technological innovation, and has, not only the universities that companies would want to be near but all the rest of the infrastructure required for starting new companies. 

<em class="interviewer">There’s so much more money required for the sciences. Do you think that there’s an imbalance because of that?</em>

Well that’s a very big concern within universities. And it’s not a yes or no question. Because the answers will be different for different places and will have nuances. But, there’s no question, the growth of government supported science since WWII has given incentives to universities to grow in science and technological areas. The fact that they can cover their indirect costs for this, and even in some cases, build buildings and facilities with the money that comes in, for doing research. That’s an incentive. There’s no question about it. Now, universities have responded differently to that, and this one right here, the University of California and the Berkeley campus, is a university that has historically had huge strength across the entire gamut of disciplines: humanities, social sciences, science, engineering, professional schools, it’s all been here. We do have concerns about keeping the strength of the fields that aren’t so eligible for government grants: humanities, fields like anthropology, and sociology that don’t have as much access as another social science, economics, or the world of natural science and engineering do to government money. So we do work to make sure that we keep our strength across the board. 

That however, is going to be put to the test once again with the shrinking of the California public support for higher ed. So, the University of California is in a situation where it’s going to have to continually assess its mission, possibly have some changes in its mission, and determine how all of that intersects with the business model, because we’ve got to have a business model that works. By business model, I mean do what we do that brings in money, be it tuition, be it state support, be it corporate research support, whatever. And it works. You have the ability to derive funds in order to pay for what is going to be your output, your product.

So the university’s business model is being tested right now because of the reduction of state support. I, for one, hope that we can remain the comprehensive university. I have a number of reasons for that. First of all, I am one who promotes heavily a broad undergraduate education, even for an engineer. I am part of a group, nationally, that is trying to convert the accredited professional engineering degree in engineering from the bachelor’s level to the masters or other graduate level. We’re not close yet, but we are working on it. I think a broad education is important for people for many reasons. 

But there is a second reason. That is that the world of universities has grown up with disciplines. Here are the disciplines and they all do things their own way, and your intellectual life is within your discipline, and different disciplines have different ways of doing things. The way an economist works is totally different from the way a sociologist would work, even though they’re both social scientists. So, the world, more and more, has exceedingly complex problems to deal with. I will take global warming as an example. There is a clear technical component to it, scientific and technical, understanding the science of global warming, understanding enough to ferret out what is man-made and what is some variable cycle and what may not be important. There’s a huge amount of fuss on that. I just read an editorial in the Wall Street Journal a day or two ago, where they had picked out some 5 or 6 scientists, whose name people in the field would know, and said they were, in one way or another, skeptics on global warming.
<p class="highlight">So, in that science always has disagreements within itself, we have the phenomenon of others trying to take that disagreement and extend it, and say, well, global warming is not a problem <em>at all</em>, for example.</p>

So, there’s a huge social aspect, a political aspect to this, and surely an economic aspect to global warming, that has to interface with the science, as we decide what to do about it as a country and as a world, all of those social concerns have to interface with the technical knowledge and concerns, and that’s something that doesn’t work well within universities. It’s very hard to get a group of scientists to work with a group of social scientists or a group of humanists. There are some examples where it’s worked well, but as a rule, it’s a difficult thing to do. So this is my other reason, now, for feeling that universities need to cover the waterfront with regard to disciplines. You have to have the pieces there when you try to find the way to integrate the thinking among disciplines in order to apply it to something like global warming, or water supply, you name it, arable lands. 

<em class="interviewer">And that’s sort of what institutes do, right? They get these people together?</em>

Yeah, we have, I think, something like 85 organized research units on the Berkeley campus, the prime mission of which is to bring people from different disciplines together. So that is one of our mechanisms. And then it relates to the industrial thing too. Let me back up a little bit from that. In the year 2000 when Gray Davis was governor of this state, he actually made substantial appropriations available. He worked with the legislature to do this, to create four, very large so-called Governor’s Institutes on Science and Innovation, within the UC system. One of the two at Berkeley is CITRIS, the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society. And the other is called QB3, Quantitative Bio-technology, which is quantitative bio-technology, bio-medicine, and areas like that. So, the governor started us off. And then, what I’m headed to is that a few years later, a major corporation, a major international corporation, BP, known for the gulf oil spill and all that subsequently, decided that it wanted to create a joint industry-university bio-energy research center, and they went around soliciting proposals, identified six groups as finalists, and eventually the group headed by the Berkeley campus won 500 million dollars, over 10 years. That’s a lot of money, and there is a building going up in downtown Berkeley right now at the corner of Oxford and Hearst, that will house that institute. 

So, let’s look at several ingredients of our conversation here. One is that we’ve ended up with a very singular involvement of a corporation on a university here with this Energy Biosciences Institute, as it’s called. The other is that a visionary governor of the state of California enabled that by his initiative to have these governor’s institutes on sciences and innovation beforehand. They were to be on areas that were promising for the future economy of California. QB3 made the argument that biologically-derived energy is important for the economy of California and that companies would locate here. Here comes BP and makes a partnership for a research center, controlled by all the policies in that area. Now where is the bio industry likely to develop? Right here in the Bay Area. Because of those things having happened. So, I think that’s in part an argument for the desirability of university/industry relations. It’s an argument for the importance of state investment in the university in order to enable things to come of the research that will improve the economy. It’s a good story. 

<em class="interviewer">I read it mentioned that it’s still a hypothesis that there’s this direct connection between the proliferation of higher education and a booming economy.</em>

Well, we think that argument is pretty clear, but you have to be careful in another direction on that one too. Because if your sole or principal justification for the university is that it’s going to make the economy boom, that is going to weaken the position of many aspects of the humanities, many things that do not, in the normal public eye, have a tie to the economy, so, at the very least, I think when that argument is made, it has to be a broader argument that says that the university’s research output is good for the economy *and* society. And there are many things we do that are for the benefit of society, as opposed to the economy. Medicine would be the most obvious one, but surely the arts, literature, etcetera, would fall in that category too. They are certainly beneficial to people, and enrich lives and make for fuller, more complete lives, and so they are part of what a university’s output is too. Then of course of principal product is none of those things, it’s educated people who are smart and will do good things in their careers.

I am very convinced of the importance of the public mission for a university like this. We are in a debate that doesn’t always get framed this way but has these elements, nationally. That debate is whether education of people is good for the individual people because it increases their earning power or is it good for society, and both arguments can be made. Historically, the argument for public universities, going back to the Morrill Act of the 1860s, is that by educating the public, you better the life for all because more people are able to do more things and have the knowledge to do it, and will also lead richer and fuller lives. If you read much of what was said back at the founding of UC, words much like that are there. So that was the original aim of public education. 

<p class="highlight">It is also true that public higher education in this country has historically been <em>the</em> avenue of upward mobility for people. So, if you are from a very low income family or a family that has no tradition of even finishing high school, and has had relatively menial jobs and thereby low in come, you still, if you have what it takes, are able to partake of public higher education, get that education and rise and do great things. There are many examples of that, a huge number of examples of that in public universities from over the years. And that’s what I think is in danger right now, is that ability to be the path of upward mobility, and I think it’s critical.</p>
The private universities are not large enough to do this. Something like 75% of the university student population in the U.S. is in public universities. Privates and for-profit universities are about 20-25%. So these public universities that we have have to be able to survive and be healthy in carrying out their public missions. And that I believe is what gets lost in the discussion. You just don’t read that that much in the newspapers. So… that’s the crux issue I think. 

<em class="interviewer">So, is it more in danger than ever?</em>

Uh huh. 

<em class="interviewer">Is it because the disparity between the rich and the poor is increasing?</em>

Well, it’s in part one of the reasons why the disparity is increasing, is that public education is losing its ability to carry its full burden. But every state, one way or another, has the problem that California has. California has parts of the problem that are unique to California, like the ease of getting ballot initiatives on, but every state has got this difficulty. And therefore there are many states where the budget for higher education is being cut way back. If you happen to read about Nevada, percent-wise, that cut is far greater than for California, so they really are hanging on for life.
<p class="highlight">The difficulty is that in the present structure of things, in the present political climate, nobody really sees a way out of the woods on this.</p>
So, if things are just left to go as they are going, they will go all the more this way, of cutting back the public budgets for higher education, which means the quality and accomplishments of the public universities will either go down or those universities are going to have to go elsewhere for financial income to enable them operating as they have been. Every source, every different source of income comes with its own set of obligations, if you want to put a negative cast on it all. The fact that the chancellor or president of a private university has to spend 50% or more of their time out there raising money, means that’s 50% or more of their time that they are not using to do good things within the university. 

It has greatly changed the natures and roles of the presidents’ and provosts’ positions over the years, by the way, because the presidency is very external looking. The provost gets the function of running it to make it work well internally. So, that’s a cost associated with private fund-raising. I’ve talked about all of these controls, and policies, and regulations we have, with regard to interactions with industry, but there’s no question that the more you get tied up with industry, and the bigger the grants or financial arrangements that occur with industry, the more potential there is for diversion of the university from the university mission, or something artificial coming into play. 

You can guard against much of it, but for sure, if we keep going more and more in that direction, things will happen which, one place or another, which will be causes of great concern. So every way of funding a university other than state fund or endowment becomes an issue of some kind. I should take the most obvious one of all, student fees. You are living here, right? So you read the San Francisco Chronicle maybe. And you then read about the Regents’ meeting last week. So this was on the question of whether to have multi-year plan of fee increases traded back and forth with increases in the state government. That is a hot, hot potato and it didn’t move with the Regents. That’s how hot the potato is. 

<em class="interviewer">It seems like there is a parallel problem with treating students as customers, as there is with working with corporations.</em>

There is. The public universities, if you look at the figures, we tend to have as much as twice the student to faculty ratio as a leading private university. And so, just because of that difference, obviously, a student is likely to have less contact with the faculty in a public than in a private, just by those numbers. We do a lot of things to try to enable that contact, and help it happen nonetheless, but that is something to worry about. And if we are headed into a world where the public universities have to increase their private dimension or private side, there will be higher fees and way more intensive fundraising from alumni, so as to try to build endowments. The public has to worry much more about the student as a customer, which has been called total quality management by some, the experience that the customer gets. That’s very true. And it happens, as would not be surprising, there is some sentiment on this campus to try to simply become a private university. That’s got all kind of complications in it, and to my mind would not be a good thing at all, but there are the two things that would make it very difficult just to become a private university. One is you’ve got to get up the intensity of contact with students, nurturing of students, for example, get your graduation rates up at all public universities to over 90%, as opposed to the 65 or 70 that it is for most public universities—we are a bit higher than that. But for very high fees, people should certainly be able to graduate and have a degree at the end of it.

And the other thing that would be very difficult for turning a leading public into a private would be the endowments. There’s a huge difference between the publics and the privates there, between the leading privates and the publics. So if you look at the endowment per student enrollment, for Harvard, or Yale, or Caltech, or Stanford, it is at least one order of magnitude, a factor of ten at least, greater than the endowment per student of the publics, even the University of Texas, which has a large amount of oil money in its endowment. So you can’t just simply change a public university into a private one, because nobody is going to be able to go out there and raise 26 billion dollars, or whatever is needed worth of endowment, in a short period of time. In a sense, the way that the world of universities works, this is a great oversimplification but it gives the idea, the state money that historically has come into the public universities equates to yield on endowment that the private universities have been able to work off of. Then their other sources of income are about the same. It’s a very crude way of looking at it. 

<em class="interviewer">Why is that? Is it old money and loyalties?</em>

And wise investment. There are a huge number of great investment success stories, which of course takes years, but several of the leading privates have done that well. And a rule of thumb is that over large periods of time, even a conservatively invested endowment should grow 6-7% a year, maybe even 8%, and then, what is usually done is that the yield from the endowment annually, the yield taken from the endowment is of the order of 5%, and the remaining earnings of the investment just build the principal of the endowment. That’s how the principals get bigger, over the years. So there’s a big difference that way. The main thing is it’s really going to be a change if the public universities gets thrown heavily into the world of endowments, annual fundraising, private giving, corporate giving, that the privates have been in much longer. 

<em class="interviewer">Just might be forced into it, just by necessity?</em>

Or we find other ways to do it. But yes, I have to say that it’s an issue, course, that receives an enormous amount of debate within the higher ed. community right now. And I really have not seen good answers appear. Failing good answers over time, then the quality of the public institutions will go down. And there will be a quality gap, faculty salary gap, everything else between the leading privates and the publics, and it would be a different world. The University of California, incidentally, historically, has been placed, knowingly, by the populace of California, in a position of trying to be about half-way between a public and a private. You’d look at plots, and yes, the privates would have somewhat higher salaries than the publics, and we’d be about half-way in between. Recently the privates have been going up, the publics have been tapering off, and now we are not half-way in between. So that’s a worry for the University of California. It will change the character and the university. 

I believe UC has done a lot for the state in terms of building it both socially and economically, and the economic examples go back to the agriculture industry. A very good example is the fact that around 1880, the legislature enacted a resolution that established a school of viticulture and enology, at Davis, that’s wine-making, and they were to do research to create a good position and knowledge base for the California wine industry. And that’s been an enormous success! And it is really one of the first very visible ways in which the university contributed economically to the state. Agriculture, as a whole, actually precedes the winemaking, because the winemaking went on hold during prohibition, and so the real taking off of the California wine industry occurred after WWII. It’s very much based on University research. It’s another example. 

These are things that will not happen if we can’t retain our level of the university. It’s the issue of the day. Which goes right back to the public university question. What can we be in the new world of funding, as it exists.
