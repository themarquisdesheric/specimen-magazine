The funding of the lab has been, to say the least, rather lean, ever since I questioned the virus AIDS hypothesis. And that's a long time ago by now. That was in '87. I'm surprised that I'm still alive anyway. And my critique of viral AIDS was in good faith. It was not because I hated somebody or I’m a mass murderer and all this kind of thing. It was just basic science. There are some very profound problems with this idea that AIDS is a viral epidemic, sexually transmitted epidemic. Where is it? 28 years later. 

This virus can not be found in people with AIDS, even when they're dying from AIDS. Only the antibody against it. For all other viruses – no exceptions, none – if the antibody is there, the virus is not doing anything. That's why vaccines work so well. They prevent the virus from getting into another cell. When the antibody is there, you cannot die from the virus, because the virus cannot be found. They can't find it. They need the polymerase chain reaction to detect traces of viral nucleic acid, because this is a method that finds a needle in a haystack. But you are not dying from a needle in a haystack. There are lots of holes in this virus-AIDS hypothesis. There are too many. Well, there are only holes in it. Often I don't see anything else.

All new pathogenic microbes cause exponential epidemics. The population gets sick exponentially, within weeks lots of people die. Then, the remainder of the population either becomes immune, through their own immunity or a vaccine if you have one, and then the epidemic disappears. So the history of microbial epidemics, viral, bacterial, or others has always been more or less the same over time. It goes up exponentially and comes down exponentially. And the classical example is the flu epidemic of 1918 in which more people died than in WWI. That's 20 million people within a couple of months. Up and down and gone it was.

But typically, the microbes claim only a couple of million of your cells to replicate without causing a disease. In some cases you get sick and in very rare cases you die. So AIDS was said to be an exception. We’re all going to die from this new virus; the population is going to be decimated. We have a new sexually transmitted virus coming from Africa.

But now, 27 years later, there is no general, heterosexual AIDS epidemic anywhere on this planet. Not in the great USA, not in Europe, not in Africa, not in India, not in Asia, nowhere. And sex has not changed a lot in the past 20 years. It's been the same since God invented it millions of years ago. As a result of unprotected sex, four and a half million babies are born in the U.S. every year, and have been born before AIDS and continue to be born, and there is no devastating AIDS epidemic among heterosexuals and babies.

<em class="interviewer">So the numbers are just not adding up.</em>


They are not adding up at all. The germ theory says the numbers go up exponentially and soon after come down exponentially. That's how it should go. The numbers don't add. The AIDS establishment is more silent about it. They don't say much about this anymore. They keep assuring you, you must drugs or else you die, but they don't discuss anymore that it's supposed to kill everybody and spread exponentially. They are more and more quiet about this now.

Anyway, so I think that there are big open questions. Nevertheless, I became the official villain responsible for everything that didn't work out in AIDS, because I advised people to ignore the virus and not to take anti-viral drugs, and now I don't get grants and students as a result of that.

No more research funds. So, I focused again on cancer which was my expertise and my interest anyway. When I first came to this country, in the sixties, the virus-cancer theory was the prevailing cancer theory. I worked then with Wendell Stanley who got the first Nobel Prize in viruses, tobacco mosaic virus. That new building next door was named after him. He was the first Nobel-virologist, and he said you can come to work with me on cancer viruses as a post-doc. The whole institute was essentially working with him, and he said the hottest thing nowadays is tumor viruses. If we can nail that down, we will make a vaccine and cancer is conquered. And that would be a big goal. A lot of people were pushing this goal at that time. So I was working on so-called retroviruses, viruses that might cause cancer because they don't kill cells.

When the virus-cancer theory didn't work out two decades later – some cancer virologists said, well, a retrovirus could at least cause AIDS. That's still important. It's not as good as cancer, but it's better than nothing. So they pushed that one. I said, well, there are problems with that too. And then I became a persona non grata for pointing out the many problems with the virus-AIDS hypothesis. No more grants, no more students, no more invited lectures – those were the immediate consequences. Ok. I said, if it's not a virus, then other things must explain AIDS and cancer. So I set out to find those other things.

<em class="interviewer">Well then, how harmless is HIV, do you think?</em>

I think it does nothing. That's how harmless it is. 

<em class="interviewer">Because a lot of people have it but they are not having symptoms?</em>

Indeed, the fact that over 30 million have HIV but no symptoms of AIDS is a strong argument that HIV is not pathogenic. At least if you can trust those estimates that the Center for Disease Control and U.N. AIDS keeps publishing. Like 30-40% of the population in South Africa, or in Africa altogether are positive. And that population has doubled in the last 25 years. That's not so bad, huh? You could say that HIV has doubled the African population. If you can replicate and procreate – despite HIV, that's not a bad sign. At the same time, they say this virus is deadly, the worst we've ever seen or we ever had.

Even in the U.S. we have 1 million HIV positives at any given time since we can test for it in '85. Now 26 years later, it's still a million. That looks like a stable population to me. We have 30,000 AIDS patients, but 30,000 out of a million is only 3%, is it? Yeah. It's not a whole lot. The normal mortality is 1.5% - 2%. And those 30,000 include all these so-called "AIDS risk groups," when you look up who is dying among those millions. It's not some antibody positive who didn't know before. It's typically one from these risk groups, which are intravenous drug users, or male homosexuals who advertise thousands of dates and use tons of chemicals to make this possible. These chemicals include cocaine, the amphetamines, the nitrite inhalants, and then come the anti-viral drugs, which are chemotherapies to get over the so-called HIV risk.

You are much better off on illicit amphetamines, and cocaine, and heroin then you are on anti-viral drugs. The primary anti-viral drugs are DNA chain terminators, which were originally designed to kill human cells for cancer therapy – not to treat harmless viruses like HIV.

See, most viruses, the majority of the viruses we know in humans and in animals are cytotoxic, meaning they kill cells in which they replicate. They kill typically a few 1,000 cells, enough for them to survive, when the immune system stops them.

But the retrovirus are so harmless, literally harmless because they do not kill cells for their survival. Moreover, they are typically latent or inert in contrast to all pathogenic viruses. They become genetic residents of the cell, if you want to call them a name. They are in there like your in-laws moving into your house. They are a nuisance but they are not killing you. And this is how the retroviruses are, and that is why they are, in theory at least, potential cancer viruses. 

It is for this reason that we studied them very carefully as so-called possible cancer viruses – because they don’t kill cells like lytic viruses, such as measles, or mumps, or polio. So if a virus kills a cell, it can't become a cancer cell, but a retrovirus is one that never kills the cell. We retrovirologists kept saying that to each other. We were the leading virologists in the ‘70s and the ‘80s for that implied reason. I was one of them. I was the blue-eyed boy in the field. I had every grant I wanted. We studied these special viruses that don't kill the cell and therefore could be the cause of cancer, and in this work I found that one of them contained a gene that caused a tumor, the so-called oncogene. This gene actually makes the cells grow faster, or hyperplastic – but these hyperplastic cells are not really cancer cells yet, and such a virus was never found in humans. That is consistent with the fact that human and even animal cancers are not contagious. The "tumor viruses” nevertheless helped us to later find that chromosomal rearrangements are the immediate precursors of cancer.

<em class="interviewer">So why did everyone get so alarmed about the HIV virus? What happened to create this?</em>

Well, because they were desperate to find a cause and a corresponding treatment for AIDS. There was pressure to find something. Again, the CDC was always hyping up a new scare, a new panic. The CDC was built up as a military unit initially in WWII and they didn't want to shrink down after WWII. In fact, they wanted to expand, so they had to invent one problem after another. And I think their last semi-hit was the polio epidemic of the ‘50s. Since then, there is nothing really, nothing that they can claim. Nevertheless, they come up with one scare story after another. All these flu epidemics are not happening, AIDS isn't a true viral epidemic either.

<p class="highlight">
  The writer John Rappaport, from Los Angeles, used to call it "science by press release.” 
</p>

Margaret Heckler, the Secretary of Health and cancer researcher Robert Gallo from the National Institiutes of Health announced by press release in Washington in April 1984 that the cause of AIDS had been found. But at that time there was no publication yet, no paper, nothing, except a speculative paper from 1983 by the French virologist Luc Montagnier. Montagnier's paper was not considered, taken serious at the time. That was before that press conference in ’84.


Why? In 1984 Reagan needed badly something to build up his reelection campaign. He hadn't talked about AIDS and he was probably too "homophobe" at the time. Maybe he talked to John Wayne about it but not to the public. I am paraphrasing now freely, but they probably told him that he needs to say something about AIDS because it looks bad with the votes. He needed the New York Times, needed Liz Taylor, and Rock Hudson, and the left votes. So he apparently tried, they tried to find something for him. So he picked up Gallo. I mean, that's at least what I heard related. He asked, is there any hope? They said, yes, Gallo is the man that found the virus, and once we have a virus, we'll have a vaccine. Don't worry. In two years, it’s all over. The New York Times jumped at it. And Liz Taylor loved it. And Mathilda Krim loved it. And founded AMFAR [The American Foundation for AIDS Research], and then Ronald Reagan was reelected. Bob Gallo from the National Institutes of Health found the virus, and Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health, promised a vaccine, so now the machine was running and the millions were flowing. That was a pivotal time, in that respect.

And the machine was rolling, ever since. At least in medical history, it was a unique public relations job getting everyone engaged. “We are all in this together” from Liz Taylor to even Ronald Reagan, reluctantly I think though. “Pro gay jogging, gay marching, gay advertising,” anything. Patients never had a voice before. All these actors wore the purple ribbon. Even at the Oscars, they were wearing them, most of them. That started with AIDS, purple. It's not so in anymore, but it was like the American flag on the president now. Even some of the politically correct professors, heterosexuals were joining in. “We're all in this together,” that was the slogan. There's lots of propaganda.

But, how could HIV cause a fatal disease? They never answered that question. They left it always open. Yeah, they said, we don't know yet, we'll find the mechanism. But the reality is that no global sexually transmitted epidemic ever materialized. It stayed in these very few rare risk groups.

Yet there was a very strong alternative explanation, which they don't want to hear about, namely recreational drugs. In the ‘70s and ‘80s, everybody was on drugs. It's a lifestyle, but they don't want to say it.

<p class="highlight">
  A drug lifestyle is politically incorrect.
</p>

Nobody should be blamed. Viruses you can't blame, that's like blaming God, you know, but lifestyle or sexual persuasions is another matter – you're homophobe, or you're against a minority, against blacks, Africans, God knows what. Viruses are politically correct, so we can deal with them.

It is the biggest windfall for pharma-companies ever. It was chemotherapy for the rest of your life! And chemotherapy is very expensive. I think it's now a 5 billion or 8 billion dollar market for AIDS drugs, so they don't want to hear that HIV doesn't need to be treated. See what I mean? It's a horrible market.

<em class="interviewer">So it's a phenomenon where the treatment may be more harmful than the symptoms?</em>
 
Yeah, for sure. The treatment for AIDS is essentially a lifetime prescription of chemotherapy. It's truly horrible. The only thing they have done – if you want to call it an improvement – is making it less toxic. They lowered doses over time because people were dying pretty fast on the original doses. And what do they give? They give you drugs, like AZT, that were developed for cancer chemotherapy, developed to kill your own cells. AZT is a DNA chain terminator, a drug designed to stop DNA synthesis in the cell. When that happens, the cell goes. And that was developed to, quote, “cure cancer.” That is cancer chemotherapy. As I said, even that is not exactly God's invention.

<em class="interviewer">Can you describe, what happened when you came out with this book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79375.Inventing_the_AIDS_Virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inventing the AIDS Virus</a>?</em>

Oh, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79375.Inventing_the_AIDS_Virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inventing the AIDS Virus</a>. Yeah. It was mentioned in the New York Times once, but always negative and always hesitant.

<em class="interviewer">So, it's been kind of pushed aside and not taken seriously?</em>

Yeah. “A lone dissenter” (New York Times, 1996). I was described as a “lone dissenter,” always the only one. They want to isolate you to zero. But there are literally hundreds or thousands of them who question it. You know the control is so tight. We had a paper on this African issue, two years ago now. It was a response to a challenge from a colleague from Harvard, Max Essex is his name. They were charging us, and me personally, as "mass murderers.” The word is printed in *Discover Magazine*, because I and the president Mbeki from South Africa questioned the merits of these anti-viral drugs for the same reason we talked about now.

The virus is very unlikely causing it, and if so, these drugs are not even depressing the virus anyway. Essex estimated 1.8 million South Africans, of South Africa, the state South Africa died from 2000 – 2005 and that was my doing and Mbeki's doing, and I would be a mass murderer.

So I responded with the argument that the reality is that the population during that same time increased by 3 million. And then they responded sort of indirectly: well, there would have 4.8 million if you hadn't knocked out the 1.8. 

When the population explodes, hardly anybody would say, well, couldn't it explode even more if it weren't for some microbe that I'm going to discover? No. It's kind of an odd situation. Since the population gained 3, but they have never been able to show that HIV does something. In tissue culture, you put the virus into human cells, they do not die, just like all other retroviruses in infected cells.

But there came anonymous letters to the university last year, that in the interests of public health, I should be investigated for some misconduct, meaning up to and possibly losing the job or some censure like being degraded or limiting teaching. But half a year later, they couldn't find any evidence, and I was exonerated. They didn't like that either. But the paper we published against Essex is gone. The paper was withdrawn by Elsevier, the publisher, at the request of anonymous "HIV researchers.” 

It's a big big publisher, and they don't want to be criticized by mainstream scientists because they need the publications. If they had taken a stand, essentially for me, that this should stay if it's not refuted, they would have been under lots of pressure from the AIDS researchers who might say, we don't want to publish with you, you're supporting a mass murderer. So, Elsevier followed suit and took the paper. I'm exonerated, but the paper is not back. The rumors still continue. I cannot show up and say here is my paper. 

<em class="interviewer">When would it have been published?</em>

In 2009.
